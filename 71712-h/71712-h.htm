  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Italian humour, says Mr. J. A. Symonds, died with Ariosto;
and, in the face of such a declaration, any attempt to bring
together a collection of specimens, some of which at any rate
belong to a more recent date, would seem to savour of presumption.
Yet, even at the risk of differing from such a recognised
authority on Italian literature, we venture to think that a
good deal has been produced since the age of Ariosto which
may legitimately be defined as humour, though, for various
reasons presently to be detailed, there are peculiar difficulties
connected with its presentation in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may as well be said at once that the professed humorist,
the writer who is comic and nothing else, or, at any rate,
whose main scope is to be funny, is all but unknown in modern
Italian literature. Strictly speaking, he is perhaps a Germanic
rather than a Latin product. The jokes in Italian comic
and other papers are not, as a rule, overpoweringly amusing;
and if we do come across a book which sets itself forth as
<cite><span lang="it">Umoristico</span></cite>, the chances are that it turns out to be very tragical
mirth indeed. But in novels and tales, even in essays
and descriptions, which have no specially humorous intention,
you often come across passages of a pure and spontaneous
humour, inimitable in its own kind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Italian humour may be said to fall into two great divisions,
or rather—for it is impossible to draw hard and fast lines—to
present two main characteristics, which are sometimes present
together, sometimes separately. The first of these is what we
may call the humour of <em>ludicrous incident</em>—a very elementary
kind indeed, comprising what is usually known as “broad farce,”
and finding its most rudimentary expression in horse-play and
practical jokes of the Theodore Hook kind. The early stages
of all literatures afford abundant examples of this; indeed, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>are some stories which appear to be so universally pleasing to
human nature that they reappear, in various forms, all the
world over, sometimes making their way into literature, sometimes
surviving in oral tradition to the present day. Boccaccio
and his predecessor, Franco Sacchetti, with numberless other
writers of the “novelle” or short stories in prose, which very
early became a striking feature in Italian literature, afford
plenty of examples. Such are the tricks played on the unlucky
Calandrino, the various “burle” (historical or not) ascribed to
the painter Buffalmacco, and the story of the wicked Franciscan
friar, who, after having been caught in his own trap and, as was
confidently hoped, exposed before a whole congregation, had
the wit to turn the situation to his own profit after all, and
preached a most eloquent sermon on the incident. The same tendency
is also seen in the “Morgante Maggiore” of Pulci, which
in its turn gave birth to a large number of “heroico-comic”
poems, most of them celebrating the adventures of some more
or less fabulous hero, and also, it must be confessed, somewhat
heavy and long-winded, the cumbrous <i><span lang="it">ottava rima</span></i> contributing
not a little to this result.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Ariosto’s great poem, of course, though
having some points in common with these—(he had two predecessors
in his treatment of the Roland legend in epic form)—stands
on an entirely different footing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other characteristic is difficult to define, and its best
examples are almost impossible to render into another language.
It consists in a peculiar, naïve drollery,—a something which
reminds one of the Irish way of relating a story, only that it is
quieter and more restrained,—a simplicity which seems almost
unconscious of the ludicrous side of what it is describing, till we
are undeceived by a sly hit here and there. This, though more
developed in modern writers, exists side by side with the
broader comic element in the older literature. There is a
certain childlike quality about the Italian of the age of Dante
that lends itself admirably to the expression of this trait.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>The French are said to possess wit, but not humour; the
Italians have humour, but not wit—or, at any rate, more of the
former than the latter. True humour is never divorced from
pathos; and it is usually allied with the power of seeing the
poetry in common things. This one notices in many writers of
the present day, such as Verga and Pratesi—whose works are
full of humour, though not of a kind that appears to advantage
in selections. It is shown in delicate elusive touches of description
and narration, and provokes smiles—sometimes sad smiles—rather
 than laughter. Verga’s humour is often grim and
bitter—the tragedy of the hard lives he writes of has its farce
too, but even that is a sad one. Something of this grimness
comes out in his cynical sketch of the village priest, who was
also farmer and money-lender—hated by his flock in one
capacity, reverenced in the other, and dreaded in both.</p>

<p class='c009'>Italy is so intimately associated with music and the drama,
that, in such a selection as the following, one might expect to
find a large number of quotations from comedies. This, however,
is not the case. With hundreds of comedies to choose
from, it is almost impossible to find anything adapted for
quotation. It is quite true that quoting from a drama must
always be more or less like handing round a brick as a sample
of the house; but in Shakespeare, for instance, we can find
abundance of single passages which will stand well enough by
themselves to give a taste of his humorous quality. Had we
been able to find in all the works of Goldoni or Gozzi, of
Gherardi del Testa, Torelli, or Ferrari, a speech approaching—I
do not say in degree, but in kind—any one of some dozen which
one might pick out almost at random, on opening <cite>Twelfth
Night</cite>, or <cite>Henry IV.</cite>, or <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite>, the task
would have been much easier than it is. But in the best
classical plays, such as Goldoni’s, the interest is much more
dependent on plot and situation than on character, and no
short selection can either give an idea of the whole or be very
amusing in itself. The liveliest bits of dialogue lose point apart
from their context, and in any case are better adapted for
acting than reading. The same might be said of any play
worth the name, but it is perhaps peculiarly true of the
eighteenth century “comedy of intrigue.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>The comedy of the present day has not quite the same
disadvantage. The stereotyped characters are done away with,
and there is more play of individuality. But it will be noticed
that the specimens given consist of one or more whole scenes,
sometimes of considerable length—<em>i.e.</em>, there is the same
deficiency, or nearly so, of quotable speeches. This, of
course, is not a fault from the dramatic point of view; but
it is embarrassing for the maker of selections.</p>

<p class='c009'>Making all these allowances, one finds some of Torelli’s and
Ferrari’s plays fairly amusing in the reading, whatever they may
be when well acted; but even so the reflection is forced upon
one that some of them are lamentable comedies indeed. It is
not that they lack spirit and vivacity, but one is astonished
at the subjects chosen. That any man should write a play
called <cite>The Duel</cite>, in which the principal incident is a duel, which
really does come off, and in which a man is killed, and then call
it a comedy, passes one’s comprehension. Not that the subject
is made light of; there are comic characters and situations, it
is true, but these are subsidiary, and the main treatment is dignified
and even pathetic. Again, we have Torelli’s <cite><span lang="it">I Mariti</span></cite>,—no
tragedy could cause one acuter misery than this drama of ill-assorted
marriages and slowly-tortured hearts. <cite><span lang="it">La Verità</span></cite>, by
the same author, would be a bright and amusing play, were it
not for the cynical bitterness of the main idea running through
it. The hero, a simple, honest young fellow from the country,
gets into trouble by his outspokenness all through the first act
or two; then, having found out that honesty does not pay,
he takes to lying and flattery, and gets on in the world
accordingly. Another example of the same tendency is Ferrari’s
<cite><span lang="it">Suicidio</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is true that the word <i><span lang="it">commedia</span></i> in Italian does not always
denote what we mean by a comedy (as witness the <cite><span lang="it">Divina
Commedia</span></cite>), but that the distinction is to some extent observed
in the modern drama is proved by the fact that some plays are
designated <i><span lang="it">commedia</span></i>, others “dramma” or “tragedia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a peculiarly national development of the drama in
Italy, which demands a word or two to itself. I mean the
<i><span lang="it">Commedia dell’ Arte</span></i>, so fully and ably discussed by Mr.
Symonds in the introduction to his recent translation of Gozzi’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span><cite>Memoirs</cite>. Briefly speaking, this is a play of which the author
furnishes only the outline—the plot, the division into acts and
scenes, and a certain number of stage directions—the words
being wholly or partly extemporised by the actors. In fact, the
dialogue of these plays consisted chiefly of “gag,” though the
extent to which this was the case appears to have varied, the
playwright sometimes supplying hints for every speech, and
even entire speeches,—sometimes only indicating the general
line taken during the scene. The <i><span lang="it">Commedia dell’ Arte</span></i> was
immensely popular during the first half of the eighteenth
century; but then declined, owing to the influence of Goldoni,
who introduced the <cite>Comedy of Manners</cite>, in which he largely
followed French models. It is curious that Molière, who thus,
one might say, was indirectly instrumental in superseding the
<i><span lang="it">Commedia dell’ Arte</span></i>, should have received his first impulse
from this very form of the drama, as brought into France
by Italian companies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most plays of this description partook rather of the character
of farce than of legitimate comedy. The principal personages—Harlequin,
Columbine, Pantaloon, Coviello, Scaramouch, etc.—who
make their appearance in every one, had certain
fixed traditional costumes and masks, which were never
departed from. The familiar figure of Punch, which has been
so completely naturalised as to appear one of the most English
of all English institutions, was handed down through many
generations of Italian players before he reached our shores. As
“Pulcinella” or “Polecenella” he is a typically Neapolitan
figure; while Stenterello, another favourite mask, is as typically
Tuscan. The name is supposed to be derived from “Stentare”
(to be in great want)—the Tuscans, and more especially the
Florentines, being famous throughout the Peninsula for economy—not
to say meanness—which is a prominent feature in Stenterello’s
character.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i><span lang="it">Commedia dell’ Arte</span></i> was eminently suited to the Italian
national character, with its fluent eloquence and spontaneous
drollery, so much of which depends on facial and vocal
expression, on ready repartee and apt allusion, that it loses
enormously on being written down.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i><span lang="it">scenario</span></i>, or outline of the acts and scenes, while it kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>the action in a definite shape and prevented over-much diffuseness,
allowed the most unlimited scope for both the tendencies
already described, though perhaps that towards broad farce and
practical joking is the most prominent. Indeed, the coarseness
into which it has ever been apt to degenerate is throughout
unpleasantly prominent. Symonds—surely not a very squeamish
critic—speaks of these farces in terms to make one think that
the oblivion into which they have fallen is not a matter for regret.
Moreover, while the coarseness of the story (independent of
what might be incidentally introduced into the dialogue) forms
part of the groundwork of the play, and would thus be perpetuated,
the subtler play of humour is much more easily
lost. The numerous comedies and farces of Francesco Cerlone,
if not actually coming within the category of the <i><span lang="it">Commedia
dell’ Arte</span></i>, may be regarded as a development of it. They are
real plays, with the speeches written out in full, and usually
a plot of the kind found in what is called the “comedy
of intrigue,” while the characters are bound by no fixed rules.
But there is always a more or less farcical underplot, in which
some of the above-mentioned stereotyped personages figure,
Pulcinella and Columbine being the principal ones. The greater
part of these scenes is in the Neapolitan dialect, traditionally
assigned to Pulcinella throughout the <i><span lang="it">Commedia dell’ Arte</span></i>.
Each of the “masks,” by-the-bye, speaks some provincial
dialect; and a great deal of humour appears to be got out
of the device of bringing two or more speakers of different
dialects on the stage at once. Molière has to a certain extent
done the same thing, notably in <cite><span lang="it">Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Further information concerning these masks may be found
in that delightful book, Story’s <cite><span lang="it">Roba di Roma</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another development of the Italian drama which must not
be passed over without notice is the comic opera, which came
into fashion during the latter half of the eighteenth century.
Casti (the author of a somewhat dreary satire, “Gli Animali
Parlanti,” the sonnet-cycle, “I Tre Giuli,” a good idea worked
to death, and some unspeakably vile <i><span lang="it">Novelle</span></i>) excelled in this
line, producing, among others, <cite><span lang="it">La Grotta di Trofonio</span></cite> and
<cite><span lang="it">Il Re Teodoro</span></cite>, which are something like Gilbert and Sullivan’s
librettos in their tripping measures and rattling fun. Other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>comic operas of the same period are <cite><span lang="it">Il Paese di Cuccagna</span></cite>, by
Carlo Goldoni, and <cite><span lang="it">L’Opera Seria</span></cite> by Ramieri Calsabigi, a parody
on the serious operas which were just then becoming fashionable.
The poet and the composer are introduced respectively
as Don Delirio and Don Sospiro (“Sighing”), and the manager
asks them in turn, “What the devil is the good of so many
sentences just at the crisis of passion?” and “Who can stand
all those cadences in the midst of an <i><span lang="it">aria</span></i> full of action?”
More modern works of this kind have been written by Pananti,
Gherardini, Lorenzo del Ponte, and Angelo Anelli (died 1820).</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Italians are good actors,” says Story, “and entirely
without self-consciousness and inflated affectation.... They are
simple and natural. Their life, which is public, out of doors, and
gregarious, gives them confidence, and by nature they are free
from self-consciousness. The same absence of artificiality that
marks their manners in life is visible on the stage. One should,
however, understand the Italian character, and know their
habits and peculiarities in order fitly to relish their acting. It
is as different from the French acting as their character is
different from that of the French.... In character-parts,
comedy and farce, they are admirable; and out of Italy the real
<i><span lang="it">buffo</span></i> does not exist. Their impersonations, without overstepping
the truth of natural oddity, exhibit a humour of
character and a general susceptibility to the absurd which
could hardly be excelled. Their farce is not dry, witty, and
sarcastic like the French, but rich, humorous, and droll. The
<i><span lang="it">primo comico</span></i>, who is always rushing from one scrape to
another, is so full of chatter and blunder, ingenuity and good-nature,
that it is impossible not to laugh with him and wish
him well; while the heavy father or irascible old uncle, in the
midst of the most grotesque and absurdly natural imitation,
without altering in the least his character, will often move you
by sudden touches of pathos when you are least prepared. The
old man is particularly well represented on the Italian stage.
In moments of excitement and emotion, despite his red bandanna
handkerchief, his spasmodic taking of snuff, and his
blowing of his nose, all of which are given with a truth which,
at first, to a stranger, trenches not slightly on the bounds of the
ludicrous—look out—by an unexpected and exquisitely natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>turn he will bring the tears at once into your eyes. I know
nothing so like this suddenness and unexpectedness of pathos
in Italian acting as certain passages in <cite>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</cite>,
which catch you quite unprepared, and, expecting to laugh, you
find yourself crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If one would see the characteristic theatres of the <i><span lang="it">basso
popolo</span></i>, and study their manners, he should go to the Teatro
Emiliano in the Piazza Navona, or the Fico, so called from the
street in which it is situated. At the former the acting is by
respectable puppets; at the latter the plays are performed by
actors or <i><span lang="it">personaggi</span></i>, as they are called. The love for the
acting of <i><span lang="it">burattini</span></i>, or puppets, is universal among the lower
classes throughout Italy, and in some cities, especially Genoa,
no pains are spared in their costume, construction, and movement
to render them life-like. They are made of wood, are
generally from two to three feet in height, with very large
heads and supernatural, glaring eyes that never wink, and are
clad in all the splendour of tinsel, velvet, and steel. Their joints
are so flexible that the least weight or strain upon them effects
a dislocation, and they are moved by wires attached to their
heads and extremities. Though the largest are only about
half the height of a man, yet, as the stage and all the appointments
and scenery are upon the same scale of proportion, the eye
is soon deceived, and accepts them as if life-size. But if by
accident a hand or arm of one of the wire-pullers appears from
behind the scenes, or descends below the hangings, it startles
you by its portentous size, and the audience in the stage-boxes,
instead of reducing the <i><span lang="it">burattini</span></i> to Lilliputians by contrast, as
they lean forward, become themselves Brobdingnagians, with
elephantine heads and hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not allow yourself to suppose that there is anything
ludicrous to the audience in the performances of these wooden
<i><span lang="it">burattini</span></i>. Nothing, on the contrary, is more serious. No
human being could be so serious. Their countenances are
solemn as death, and more unchanging than the face of a clock.
Their terrible gravity when, with drooping heads and collapsed
arms, they fix on you their great goggle eyes, is at times
ghastly. They never descend into the regions of conscious
farce. The plays they perform are mostly heroic, romantic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>and historical.... The audience listen with grave and profound
interest. To them the actors are not <i><span lang="it">fantoccini</span></i>, but
heroes. Their inflated and extravagant discourse is simply
grand and noble. They are the mighty <em>x</em> which represents the
unknown quantity of boasting which potentially exists in the
bosom of every one. Do not laugh when you enter, or the
general look of surprise and annoyance will at once recall you
to the proprieties of the occasion. You might as well laugh in
a church....</p>

<p class='c009'>“At every theatre there are two performances, or <i><span lang="it">camerate</span></i>,
every evening, one commencing at <i><span lang="it">Ave Maria</span></i> (sunset), the
other at ten o’clock. We arrived at the Teatro Emiliano just
too late for the first, as we learned at the ticket-office. ‘What
is that great noise of drums inside?’ asked we. ‘<i><span lang="it">Battaglie</span></i>,’
said the ticket-seller. ‘Shall we see a battle in the next
piece?’ ‘<i><span lang="it">Eh, sempre battaglie!</span></i>’ (Always battles) was the
reproving answer....</p>

<p class='c009'>“The bill pasted outside informed us that the <i><span lang="it">burattini</span></i> were
to play to-night ‘The <i><span lang="it">grandiose</span></i> opera, entitled, <cite>Belisarius, or
the Adventures of Orestes, Ersilia, Falsierone, Selenguerro,
and the terrible Hunchback</cite>.’ In the names themselves there
was a sound of horror and fear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The writer goes on to describe the play in a very humorous
fashion, but as the humour is only apparent from the spectator’s
point of view, and does not belong to the work represented, we
must not digress so far as to quote it at full length. The
conclusion, however, may be given. “... Suffice it to say that
there was the ‘Serpent-man,’ ending in a long green tail, and
a terrible giant with a negro head and pock-marked face, each
of which was a <i><span lang="it">Deus ex machina</span></i>, descending at opportune
moments to assist one or the other side, the <i><span lang="it">uomo serpente</span></i> on
one occasion crushing a warrior who was engaged in an
encounter with Ersilia, by flinging a great tower on him. What
Belisario had to do with this <i><span lang="it">grandiosa opera</span></i>, besides giving it
his name, I did not plainly see, as he never made his appearance
on the stage. However, the audience seemed greatly delighted
with the performance. They ate voraciously of <i><span lang="it">bruscolini</span></i>
(pumpkin seeds, salted and cooked in a furnace, of which
the Romans are very fond) and cakes, partook largely of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>lemonade, and when I left the stage was strewn with <i><span lang="it">cornetti</span></i>,
or paper horns, which they had emptied of their seeds.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The use of dialect in the comic drama has been already
adverted to. At the present day “dialect stories” are almost
as popular in Italy as they have been, for some time past, in
the American magazines. The Neapolitan dialect, so closely
connected with Pulcinella, has become as much a stock property
of the Italian comic muse, as the brogue of the stage Irishman
is of the English. A paper, entirely in this dialect, entitled,
“Lo Cuorpo de Napole e lo Sebbeto,” was published for some
time at Naples, in the early sixties; but its humour was
exclusively political, and of a local and temporary character.
The Sicilian dialect has been brought into notice by Verga
(whose actual use of it, however, is sparing), Navarro della
Miraglia, Capuana, and other writers. Goldoni used the
Venetian throughout some of his best comedies (<cite><span lang="it">Le Baruffe
Chiozzote</span></cite>, for instance), but it seems to have fallen comparatively
out of favour of late years. D’Annunzio, in his <cite><span lang="it">San
Pantaleone</span></cite>, and other stories, has made very effective use of the
dialect spoken along the Adriatic coast, about Pescara and
Ortona, which is a kind of cross between the Venetian and
Neapolitan. In Piedmont there appears to be a mass of
popular literature in the (to outsiders) singularly unattractive
<i><span lang="it">patois</span></i> which was so dear to Cavour and Victor Emmanuel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the cities of the Peninsula, Milan and Florence
enjoy a pre-eminent reputation for humour. The Florentines
of the Middle Ages were famous for their biting wit and
satirical speeches, their “motti” and “frizzi.” Franco Sacchetti
and Luigi Pulci were Florentines, and Boccaccio was next door
to one, being a native of Certaldo. Even Dante, though the
last man in the world of whom one would expect anything in
the way of humorous utterance, was not without a certain grim
facetiousness of his own, as when he turned on the jeering
courtiers at Verona with a bitter play on the name of <cite><span lang="it">Can Grande</span></cite>,
or annihilated the harmless bore in Santa Maria Novella, with
his “<span lang="it">Or bene, o lionfante, non mi dar noia</span>.” Giusti, whose
poems are described as “rather satirical than humorous”
(though, as satire is one department of humour, it is rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>difficult to see the point of the definition), is in many respects a
typical Florentine, though not one by birth, his native place
being Monsummano, in the Lucca district. His poems exhibit
a singular union of caustic sarcasm and irony, fierce earnestness
and merry, rattling <i><span lang="it">disinvoltura</span></i>—light-hearted Tuscan
laughter. He wrote chiefly on political subjects, and never did
political poet have worthier themes for his verse. The times in
which he lived were sufficient to call forth any amount of <i><span lang="it">saeva
indignatio</span></i>, and if the bitterness sometimes ran so high as to
leave no heart for mirth at the pitiful incongruity of human
affairs (as in <i><span lang="it">A noi, larve d’Italia</span></i>), no one who cares for
freedom, or to whom the name of Italy is dear, can blame him.
Irish hearts can understand the note of deep personal pain
that breaks out in “King Log,” or “Weathercock’s Toast,” or
the scathing scorn of “Gingillino”;—we have nothing quite like
it in English literature. The cause is wanting. We see the
same thing in looking over a collection of Italian political
caricatures extending over the last thirty or forty years. Some
of the cartoons in <cite><span lang="it">Lo Spirito Folletto</span></cite> are equal (I am not
speaking of minor technical details, of which I am no judge) to
the best of Tenniel’s, and the ideal figure of Italy is of rare beauty;
but they do not give us what, as a rule, we are accustomed to
look for in a cartoon. Now and then, in a serious mood, the
artist just named gives us a noble drawing, which is in no sense
a caricature; but no work of his causes—nor is it in nature that
it should do so—the thrill, the <i><span lang="fr">serrement de cœur</span></i>, we feel before
the Aspromonte drawing, with its mournful legend, “Behold
and see if there is any sorrow like unto my sorrow;” or that
haunting picture of the “Italia Irredenta” riots of 1882, where
Italy looks on the dead body of young Oberdank. We have
not fought against hopeless odds for a suffering country.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in spite of this earnestness (which is usually said to be
fatal to a sense of humour), the Tuscan love of fun was always
bubbling up in Giusti. His letters, in which he was continually
falling into the racy idioms of his native hill-country, are full of it;
and some of his poems are purely playful, without political or
satiric intention—or, if satiric, only in a kindly spirit. Such is
the poem of “Love and a Quiet Life,” from which we have
given an extract. There seems to be no English version of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>best of Giusti’s works, and these offer peculiar difficulties to the
translator. I have not ventured to lay hands on the “Brindisi
di Girella”—a process which could only result in spoiling that
inimitable poem—and have contented myself with the excellent
renderings of “L’Amor Pacifico,” and some stanzas from
“Gingillino,” contributed some thirty years ago to the <cite>Cornhill
Magazine</cite> by an anonymous writer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tuscan rural life has been admirably painted of late years by,
among others, Mario Pratesi and Renato Fucini, both writers
of considerable graphic power and a certain “pawky” humour,
though they seem to prefer tragedy to comedy. The latter’s
sketch of a day in a Tuscan country-house has been included
in the present collection.</p>

<p class='c009'>So much for Florence and Tuscany. Milan is famous in
Italy for various things—for its Duomo and the singing at La
Scala—for the gallant fight for liberty during the Five Days
in ’48—and for the mysterious delicacies known as <i><span lang="it">polpette</span></i> and
<i><span lang="it">panettone</span></i>. But besides all these things, the Milanese are noted
for a love of jokes and laughter, which they endeavoured
heroically to suppress in the days of the Austrian dominion.
They possess a dialect which seems as though it were intended
for the comic stage, and lends itself excellently well to Aristophanic
wit; and they have had a dialect-poet of some note—Giacomo
Porta, the friend of Grossi and Giusti. Giusti had a
great sense of the humorous capabilities of the Milanese
dialect, and quoted verses in it (or, more probably, improvised
quotations) in letters to his Milanese friends. Unfortunately
Porta’s poems are so strictly local, and lose so much by translation,
that none of them have been found available for this
book.</p>

<p class='c009'>As a rule, the prose specimens of Italian humour have been
more satisfactory (as far as the present work is concerned) than
the poetical, for two reasons—first, the latter are more difficult to
translate with any degree of point and spirit; and secondly,
whether from the choice of metre or other causes, they are apt
to become long-winded, if not heavy. The favourite measure for
humorous poems, which cannot exactly be described as satires,
is a six-line stanza, like that of Horace Smith’s “Address to the
Mummy”; in fact, the <i><span lang="it">ottava rima</span></i> stanza, docked of two lines.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>Now, a division into stanzas is not, as a rule, favourable to rapid
or spirited narration, and the longer the stanza the greater the
difficulty. Unless the thought exactly fits the limit, it must be
either abruptly contracted to bring it within the compass of the
stanza, or expanded by feeble paraphrase and repetition;
otherwise the <i><span lang="it">enjambements</span></i> resulting from the carrying on of a
sentence from one stanza into another are apt to be awkward
and obscure, unless very skilfully managed. Pananti, in his
“Poeta di Teatro” (from which I have given a quotation), is very
happy in this stanza; the measure flows easily, and the poem
is not, in the original, too diffuse, the accumulation of trivial
details having a naïvely ludicrous effect, which is lost to some
extent in English. Pananti, by-the-bye, was a Tuscan, as was
also the genial physician, Redi, whose dithyramb in praise of
the wine of Montepulciano (he also wrote a great number of
pleasant letters, and some papers on natural history, which
show him to have been an accurate observer as well as an
enthusiastic lover of nature) has been spiritedly translated by
Leigh Hunt. So, too, was another doctor, Guadagnoli, whose
collection of <cite><span lang="it">Poesie giocose</span></cite> contains some good things, but
none in a sufficiently concentrated form for quotation.</p>

<p class='c009'>In speaking of the humorous literature of Italy, we must not
forget to notice the English influence which made itself so
strongly felt during the eighteenth century. Swift, Addison, and
Sterne found not only eager readers, but imitators. Giuseppe
Baretti, the friend of Johnson, who, after a prolonged residence
in London, returned to Italy for a few years, probably did something
towards popularising the language and literature of his
adopted country. Count Gasparo Gozzi (elder brother to Carlo
Gozzi, of the <cite><span lang="it">Memorie</span></cite> and the <cite><span lang="it">Fiabe</span></cite>) founded and carried
on for some time, at Venice, a journal called <cite><span lang="it">L’Osservatore</span></cite>,
avowedly on the model of the <cite>Spectator</cite>; and though he was no
servile imitator, his writings have an unmistakable Addisonian
flavour. Sterne’s influence was, perhaps, more widely felt than
any other. Ugo Foscolo probably came under it when writing
<cite><span lang="it">Didimo Chierico</span></cite>; and the frequent allusions to the <cite>Sentimental
Journey</cite> in Italian writers prove it to have been widely read.
Leopardi’s intensely original individuality owed little to any
writer; yet I cannot help thinking that he may have found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>Swift, to whom he was in some respects akin, both suggestive
and stimulating. Certainly, the masterly dialogues exhibit a
bitter saturnine humour very like Swift’s misanthropic irony,
though more subtle and refined, and rendered still more
striking by that innocent-seeming <i><span lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> of expression which
is so peculiarly Italian. The dialogue between the “First
Hour and the Sun,” now translated, is one of the best;
but “The Wager of Prometheus” is exceedingly fine, though
too long to quote entire, and difficult to select from. I have
examined the translation of some of these dialogues by Mr.
Charles Edwards in Trübner’s <cite>Philosophical Library</cite>, but, after
consideration, found myself unable to make use of them.
Apart from a few minor inaccuracies, which could easily have
been corrected, it was evident that the translator had his mind
fixed on Leopardi’s philosophy, and the peculiar humorous
quality of the dialogues had almost disappeared in his version.
The bull, which the Edgeworths laboured so hard to prove not
indigenous to Ireland, or at least not peculiar to the Green Isle,
flourishes vigorously in Italy. It naturally would be of frequent
occurrence among a quick-witted people, ready of speech, who,
in their haste to reach the salient points which have struck
their imagination, omit to express the connecting links, and so
make that absurd which is perfectly clear to their own minds.
Into the wilderness of definition we will not enter; but there
appear to be two principal kinds of bulls,—one in which
the man’s idea is sensible enough, though it appears nonsense
to others, because of his excessive brevity, as in “He sent me
to the devil and I came straight to your honour;” and another
in which it is in itself nonsense, because he has overlooked one
essential condition. Thus, when the blind man in Pratesi’s
<cite><span lang="it">Dottor Febo</span></cite> is eagerly asseverating something, he exclaims,
“May I <em>become blind</em> if...!” Castiglione records another
bull of this kind (it will be found on page <a href='#Page_28'>28</a>), which will at
once be recognised as an old and familiar friend; and others
will be met with in the course of the volume.</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be confessed that Italian humour is often of the
Aristophanic order, not merely in that (as has been already
hinted) a great deal of it is concerned with topics usually
(among us) omitted from polite conversation, but also in the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>than free-and-easy way in which the Unseen is frequently dealt
with. The worship of the saints—whatever may be said to
the contrary—stands much upon the same footing among the
ignorant and superstitious peasantry of Southern Italy (it is not
so true of the Tuscans) as the polytheism of ancient Greece
and Rome. And if familiarity bred contempt in the case of
Aristophanes (it may not have been so—and we dare not say,
in the face of learned commentators, that it was—but it
certainly looks like it), like causes have produced like effects in
Naples and Sicily. The Neapolitan lazzaroni has scant respect
for San Gennaro, when the latter shows no signs of acceding to
his wishes, but calls him <i><span lang="it">animale</span></i> and <i><span lang="it">canaglia</span></i>, and worse names
than that. Capuana has an exceedingly characteristic sketch,
entitled “Rottura col Patriarca,” in which a gentleman, who
considers himself badly treated by St. Joseph, the patron of
married couples (being disappointed in his hopes of an heir,
besides numerous other misfortunes), declares that he has
formally broken with that saint, and throws his picture out
of window. His confessor remonstrates with him for his
language on the subject, which is, to say the least, unparliamentary;
but the gentleman replies, “As a patriarch, and the
husband of the Virgin, I am willing to accord him all due
respect, but&#160;... in short, he has behaved very shabbily, and
I will have no more to do with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This suggests the subject of ejaculations, oaths, and imprecations,
of which the Italians have an infinite variety, and as
some of the most characteristic occur untranslated in the
following selections, a few words of explanation may not be
out of place. The subject has been treated so well by Story,
that I cannot forbear quoting him once more, especially as the
passage throws curious side-lights on some aspects of the
national character.</p>

<p class='c009'>“... By the way, a curious feature in the oaths of the
Italians may be remarked. ‘<i><span lang="it">Dio mio!</span></i>’ is merely an exclamation
of sudden surprise or wonder; ‘<i><span lang="it">Madonna mia</span></i>,’ of pity
and sorrow; and ‘<i><span lang="it">Per Cristo</span></i>,’ of hatred and revenge. It is in
the name of Christ (and not of God, as with us) that imprecations,
curses, and maledictions are invoked by an Italian
upon persons and things which have excited his rage; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>reason is very simple. Christ is to him the judge and avenger
of all, and so represented in every picture he sees, from
Orcagna’s and Michael Angelo’s ‘Last Judgment’ down,
while the Eternal Father is a peaceful old figure bending over
him as he hurls down denunciations on the damned. Christ
has but two aspects for him—one as the <i><span lang="it">bambino</span></i>, or baby, for
which he cares nothing, and one as the terrible avenger of all.
The oath comes from the Middle Ages, when Christ was looked
upon mostly in the latter aspect; but in modern days, He is
regarded as the innocent babe upon the lap of the Madonna.
Generally, the oaths of the Italians are pleasant, and they have
not forgotten some which their ancient ancestors used. They
still swear by the loveliest of the heathen deities, the god of
genial nature, Bacchus; and among their commonest exclamations
are, ‘<i><span lang="it">Per Bacco</span></i>,’ ‘<i><span lang="it">Corpo di Bacco</span></i>,’ and even sometimes,
in Tuscany particularly, ‘<i><span lang="it">Per Bacco d’India</span></i>,’ or ‘<i><span lang="it">Per Dingi</span></i>’
(sometimes <i><span lang="it">Perdinci</span></i>) <i><span lang="it">Bacco</span></i> (for <i><span lang="it">Dionigi</span></i>).” (To this we may
add, “<i><span lang="it">Per Diana</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="it">Corpo di Diana</span></i>,” which are still common.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is very common among them also to swear by some
beautiful plant, as by capers (<i><span lang="it">capperi</span></i>) or the arbutus fruit
(<i><span lang="it">corbezzoli</span></i>), as well as by the arch-priest, <i><span lang="it">arciprete</span></i>, whoever he
may be. Nor do they disdain to give force to their sentiments
on special occasions even by calling the cabbage to witness
(<i><span lang="it">Cavolo</span></i>).”</p>

<p class='c009'>To this category belongs “<i><span lang="it">Persicomele!</span></i>” (“Peaches and
apples!”) the favourite exclamation of the jolly ecclesiastic in a
sketch of Mario Pratesi’s, quoted in this volume. It will also
be remembered how another Tuscan writer, Renato Fucini,
makes a conscientious priest—shocked at the strong language
used by his ecclesiastical superior, who flings “<i><span lang="it">Giuraddio’s</span></i>” and
“<i><span lang="it">Per Dio’s</span></i>” about him on the smallest provocation—neutralise
the effect, so to speak, by adding the milder and more legitimate
“<i><span lang="it">Bacco</span></i>.” The Tuscans are celebrated throughout Italy for
profane swearing. Pratesi speaks of “blaspheming according
to the brutal Tuscan use,” and a recent writer, spending a few
weeks at Sorrento, when in conversation with a boatman,
challenged the latter to guess what part of Italy he came from.
The man guessed several provinces unsuccessfully, and when
told that his fare was a Florentine was unwilling to believe it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>“<span lang="it">perchè non avete bestemmiato il Santo nome di Dio.</span>” But in
this respect I believe the Sicilians and Neapolitans are not
much behind the Tuscans. Their profanity is not like that of
the English costermonger or bargeman—a repetition of more or
less unreportable “swear-words,” without much coherence or
meaning; but rather a system of elaborate cursing, in which the
most appalling evils are wished in detail to the offending party,
or else a volley of undisguised abuse addressed to the unseen
powers, who are apostrophised without any circumlocution
whatever. “He went away, blaspheming bad words (<i><span lang="it">bestemmiando
parolacce</span></i>), enough to make heaven and earth tremble,”
says Verga.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the most general oath,” to continue our quotation, “is
<i><span lang="it">accidente</span></i>, or apoplexy, which one hears on all occasions. This
word as ordinarily employed is merely an expletive or exclamation,
but when used in anger intentionally as a malediction,
under the form ‘<i><span lang="it">Ch’un accidente te piglia</span></i>’ (May an apoplexy
overtake you!), it is the most terrible imprecation that ever
came from the lips of a Catholic; for its real meaning is,
‘May so sudden a death strike you that you may have no
chance of absolution by the priest, and so go down to hell.’
And as every true Catholic hopes by confession on his death-bed
to obtain remission and absolution for all the sins of his
life, this malediction, by cutting him off from such an arrangement,
puts his soul in absolute danger of damnation; nay, if he
have not accidentally confessed immediately before the apoplexy
comes, sends him posting straight to hell. The being not utterable
to ears polite is seldom referred to in Rome by his actual
name, <em>Diavolo</em>, and our phrase, ‘Go to the devil,’ is shocking
to an Italian; but they smooth down his name into ‘<em>Diamine</em>,’
or ‘<em>Diascane</em>,’ and thus save their consciences and their tongues
from offence.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>Another Aristophanic feature, and one which seems to have
appealed to the mediæval imagination all over Europe, so
strongly as to have survived far beyond mediæval times, is the
constant insistence on the folly and worthlessness of women.
This proves, if anything (as in the fable of the lion and the
statue), that it was the men who told the stories and made the
proverbs; at the same time, the tendency is perhaps more marked
in Italy than in other countries, and in a collection intended to
be representative, it seemed right to give a sufficient number of
specimens to illustrate it. Such is the rather pointless story
about Domenico da Cigoli, preserved in a collection of 1600—and
a glance down our two pages of proverbs will show
what might otherwise seem an unfair proportion of misogynistic
sentiment.</p>

<p class='c009'>No survey of the humorous literature of Italy would be complete
which did not take into account the blighting influence of
the censorship, only abolished within the last thirty years.
Dangerous, if not fatal, as such an institution must be to literature
in general, the humorous <em>genre</em> feels its effects more than
any other. It may be said that, considering the astonishing
length which the earlier satirists, and even more modern writers
of fairly decent repute, have gone in the direction of offences
against good taste, to say nothing of morality, it is astonishing
that they should have had anything to complain of in the way
of restrictions. But the animus of the political censorship
seems to have been reserved for anything that savoured of
liberalism—a term which included the very mildest approach to
a criticism on the Government or its actions; while the Inquisition
has always been inclined to regard the faintest suspicion of
a heretical dogma in theology as a far worse offence than any
amount of mere indecency. Even had the censorship been exercised
with more strictness in this direction, the facilities for
contraband production would have neutralised its restraints,
while it lay like a dead weight on all healthy intellectual
activity. For though professedly free in some directions, the
human mind is enslaved if fettered in any. The knowledge that
politics, religion, or any other topic is a forbidden subject, exercises
a paralysing influence on the mind, even of writers who
have no particular inclination to take up that line. It is like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>Bluebeard’s prohibition of the hundredth room—not only does
the locked door immediately arouse the desire to enter, but the
ninety-nine open ones immediately lose all interest. If a practical
commentary on Milton’s <cite><span lang="it">Areopagitica</span></cite> were needed it might
be found in the history of the short-lived <cite><span lang="it">Conciliatore</span></cite>, the
journal started by Silvio Pellico and his friends at Milan about
1818. Story gives a striking picture of the Roman censorship
under the Papal Government previous to 1870.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing can be either published or performed in Rome
without first submitting to the censorship and obtaining the permission
of the ‘<span lang="la">Custodes morum et rotulorum</span>.’ Nor is this a
mere form; on the contrary, it is a severe ordeal, out of which
many a play comes so mangled as scarcely to be recognisable.
The pen of the censor is sometimes so ruthlessly struck through
whole acts and scenes that the fragments do not sufficiently
hang together to make the action intelligible, and sometimes
permission is absolutely refused to act the play at all. In these
latter days the wicked people are so ready to catch at any words
expressing liberal sentiments, and so apt to give a political
significance to innocent phrases, that it behoves the censor to
put on his best spectacles. Yet such is the perversity of the
audience that his utmost care often proves unavailing, and
sometimes plays are ordered to be withdrawn from the boards
after they have been played by permission.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same process goes on with the <i><span lang="it">libretti</span></i> of the operas, and
some of the requirements recall the fable of the ostrich, which,
by merely hiding its head, fondly imagines it can render its
whole body invisible. Imitating this remarkable bird, they
have attempted to conceal the offence of certain well-known
operas, with every air and word of which the Romans are
familiar, simply by changing the title and the names of the
characters, while the story remains intact. Thus certain
scandalous and shameful stories attaching to the name of
Alexander VI. and to the family of the Borgia, the title of
Donizetti’s famous opera, which every <i><span lang="it">gamin</span></i> of Rome can sing,
has been altered to that of <cite><span lang="it">Elena da Fosca</span></cite>, and under this
name alone is it permitted to be played. In like manner <cite><span lang="it">I
Puritani</span></cite> is whitewashed in <cite><span lang="it">Elvira Walton</span></cite>; and in the famous
<i><span lang="it">duo</span></i> of <cite><span lang="it">Suoni la Tromba</span></cite> the words <i><span lang="it">gridando libertà</span></i> (shouting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>liberty) become <i><span lang="it">gridando lealtà</span></i> (shouting loyalty)—liberty being
a kind of thing of which the less that is said or sung in Rome
the better. This amiable Government also, unwilling to foster
a belief in devils, rebaptises <cite><span lang="it">Roberto il Diavolo</span></cite> into <cite><span lang="it">Roberto in
Picardia</span></cite>, and conceals the name of William Tell under that of
Rodolfo di Sterlink. <cite><span lang="fr">Les Huguenots</span></cite> in the same way becomes
in Rome <cite><span lang="it">Gli Anglicani</span></cite>, and <cite><span lang="it">Norma</span></cite> sinks into <cite><span lang="it">La Foresta
d’Irminsac</span></cite>. Yet notwithstanding this, the principal airs and
concerted pieces are publicly sold with their original names at
all the shops. Oh, Papal ostrich! what bird is more foolish
than thou?”</p>

<p class='c009'>We find, from Minghetti’s <cite><span lang="it">Memoirs</span></cite>, that in 1864, at Bologna
(then in the Papal State), any publication had to run the
gauntlet of no less than <em>seven</em> censorships, and obtain the
approval of—(1) The Literary Censor; (2) the Ecclesiastical
Censor; (3) the Political Censor; (4) the Sant’ Uffizio (Inquisition).
Then came—(5) Permission from the Bishop of the
Diocese; (6) Permission from the Police; (7) Final Revision
by the Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c009'>It remains to say a few words about the translations included
in this volume. When I could find any existing versions suited
to my purpose, I have adopted them, always acknowledging
their source; in other cases, I have myself translated the necessary
passages. In doing this I have rather aimed at giving a
coherent picture of what the author had in his mind, in a style
which would at least give some idea of his tone and method of
treatment, than at rendering his exact words, and any one
having the curiosity to examine the originals would often find
considerable liberties taken with the text. I have expanded
here and contracted there—sometimes paraphrased, by giving
corresponding English idioms or proverbs—sometimes tried to
preserve the racy quaintness of the original, by rendering a
mode of speech as it stands. “He said he would tie it to his
finger till doomsday”—to indicate undying remembrance of an
injury; and “It costs the very eyes out of one’s head”—“making
a hole in the water” (for labour in vain)—“As pleased
as an Easter day” (<i><span lang="it">contento come una pasqua</span></i>)—are vivid and
picturesque locutions which it is a pity to disguise under more
commonplace phraseology. The specimens are taken from all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>periods of Italian literature; and represent, as far as possible,
all its departments; though, as has been already pointed out,
there are some rich and fruitful tracts of country in that wide
region, in which we have been able to gather little or nothing.
That the collection is in any sense complete or exhaustive
cannot be pretended; but a <i><span lang="it">Florilegium</span></i> of translations can
never be other than a very sorry representative of an original
literature.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>CALANDRINO FINDS THE STONE HELIOTROPE.</em></h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_002.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>There dwelt not long since in our city of Florence a
painter named Calandrino, a man of simple mind,
and much addicted to
novelties. The most of his
time he spent in the company
of two brother painters,
Bruno and Buffalmacco,
both men of humour and
mirth, and somewhat satirical.
There lived in Florence,
at the same time, a young
man of very engaging manners,
witty and agreeable,
called Maso del Saggio, who,
hearing of the extreme simplicity
of Calandrino, resolved
to derive some amusement
from his love of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>marvellous, and to excite his curiosity by some novel and
wonderful tales. Happening, therefore, to meet him one day
in the Church of St. John, and observing him attentively engaged
in admiring the painting and sculpture of the tabernacle
which had been lately placed over the altar in that church, he
thought he had found a fit opportunity of putting his scheme
into execution; and acquainting one of his friends with his
intentions, they walked together to the spot where Calandrino
was seated by himself, and, seeming not to be aware of
his presence, began to converse on the qualities of precious
stones, of which Maso spoke with all the confidence of an
experienced and skilful lapidary. Calandrino lent a ready
ear to this conference, and, perceiving from their loud
speaking that their conversation was not of a private nature,
he accosted them. Maso was not a little delighted at this,
and, pursuing his discourse, Calandrino asked him where
these stones were to be found. Maso replied, “They mostly
abound in Berlinzone, near a city of the Baschi, in a country
called Bengodi, in which the vines are tied with sausages,
a goose is sold for a penny, and the goslings given into the
bargain; where there is also a high mountain made of
Parmesan grated cheese, whereon dwell people whose sole
employ is to make macaroni and other dainties, boiling them
with capon broth, and afterwards throwing them out to all
who choose to catch them; and near to the mountain runs
a river of white wine, the best that ever was drunk, and
without one drop of water in it.” “Oh!” exclaimed Calandrino,
“what a delightful country to live in! But pray, sir,
tell me, what do they with the capons after they have boiled
them?” “The Baschi,” said Maso, “eat them all!” “Have
you,” said Calandrino, “ever been in that country?” “How,”
answered Maso; “do you ask me if I were ever there? A
thousand times at the least!” “And how far, I pray you,
is this happy land from our city?” quoth Calandrino. “In
truth,” replied Maso, “the miles are scarcely to be numbered;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>but, for the most part, we travel when we are in our beds at
night, and if a man dream aright, he may be there in a few
minutes.”... Calandrino, observing that Maso delivered
all these speeches with a steadfast and grave countenance,
believed them all, and said with much simplicity, “Believe
me, sir, the journey is too far for me to undertake, but if it
were somewhat nearer, I should like to accompany you
thither. But now we are conversing, allow me to ask you,
sir, whether or not any of the precious stones you spoke of
are to be found in that country?” “Yes, indeed,” replied
Maso; “there are two kinds of them to be found in those
territories, and both possessing eminent virtues. The one
kind are the sandstones of Settigniano and of Montisei....
The other is a stone which most of our lapidaries call
heliotropium, and is of admirable virtue, for whoever
carries it about his person is thereby rendered invisible
as long as he pleases.” Calandrino then said, “This
is wonderful indeed; but where else are these latter kind
to be found?” To which Maso replied, “They are
not infrequently to be found on our Mugnone.” “Of
what size and colour is this stone?” said Calandrino.
“It is of various sizes,” replied Maso, “some larger than
others, but uniformly black.” Calandrino, treasuring up all
these things in his mind, and pretending to have some
urgent business on hand, took leave of Maso, secretly proposing
to himself to go in quest of these stones, but
resolved to do nothing until he had first seen his friends,
Bruno and Buffalmacco, to whom he was much attached.
Having found them, and told them about the wonderful
stone, he proposed that they should at once go in search of
it. Bruno signified his assent, but turning to Buffalmacco,
said, “I fully agree with Calandrino, but I do not think
that this is the proper time for our search, as the sun is
now high, and so hot that we shall find all the stones on
Mugnone dried and parched, and the very blackest will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>now seem the whitest. But in the morning, when the dew
is on the ground, and before the sun has dried the earth,
every stone will have its true colour. Besides, there are
many labourers now working in the plain, who, seeing us
occupied in so serious a search, may guess what we are
seeking for, and may chance to find the stones before us,
and we may then have our labour for our pains. Therefore,
in my opinion, this is an enterprise that should be
taken in hand early in the morning, when the black stones
will be easily distinguished from the white, and a festival
day were the best of all others, as there will be nobody
abroad to discover us.” Buffalmacco applauded the advice
of Bruno, and Calandrino assenting to it, they agreed
that Sunday morning next ensuing should be the time
when they would all go in pursuit of the stone; but
Calandrino entreated them above all things not to reveal
it to any person living, as it was confided to him in strict
secrecy. Calandrino waited impatiently for Sunday morning,
when he called upon his companions before break of
day. They all then went out of the city at the gate of San
Gallo, and did not halt until they came to the plain of
Mugnone, where they immediately commenced their search
for the marvellous stone. Calandrino went stealing on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>before the other two, persuading himself that he was born
to find the heliotropium; and, looking on every side of
him, he rejected all other stones but the black, with which
he filled first his breast, and afterwards both of his pockets.
He then took off his large painting-apron, which he
fastened with his girdle in the manner of a sack, and filled
that also; and, still not satisfied, he spread abroad his
cloak, which, being also loaded with stones, he bound up
carefully, for fear of losing the very best of them. Buffalmacco
and Bruno during this time attentively eyed
Calandrino, and observing that he had now completely
loaded himself, and that their dinner-hour was drawing
nigh, Bruno, according to their arrangement, said to Buffalmacco,
pretending not to see Calandrino, although he was
not far from them, “Buffalmacco, what has become of
Calandrino?” Buffalmacco, who saw him close at hand,
gazing all round, as if desirous to find him, replied,
“I saw him even now before us, hard by.” “Undoubtedly,”
said Bruno, “he has given us the slip and gone
secretly home to dinner, and, making fools of us, has left
us to pick up black stones on these scorching plains of
Mugnone.” Calandrino, hearing them make use of these
words while he stood so near to them, imagined that he had
possessed himself of the genuine stone, and that by virtue
of its qualities he was become invisible to his companions.
His joy was now unbounded, and without saying a word,
he resolved to return home with all speed, leaving his
friends to provide for themselves. Buffalmacco, perceiving
his intent, said to Bruno, “Why should we remain here
any longer? Let us return to the city.” To which Bruno
replied, “Yes, let us go; but I vow that Calandrino shall
no more make a fool of me; and were I now as near him
as I was not long since, I would give him such a remembrance
on the heel with this flint stone as should stick by
him a month, and give him a lasting lesson;” and ere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>he had well finished the words
he struck Calandrino a violent
blow on the heel with the
stone. Though the blow was
evidently very painful, Calandrino
still preserved his silence,
and only mended his pace.
Buffalmacco then, selecting
another large flint stone, said
to Bruno, “Thou seest this
pebble! If Calandrino were
but here he should have a
brave knock on the loins;”
and, taking aim, he threw it
and struck Calandrino a violent
blow on the back; and then
all the way along the plains of
Mugnone they did nothing but
pelt him with stones, jesting
and laughing until they came
to the gate of San Gallo. They
then threw down the remainder
of the stones they had gathered,
and, stepping before Calandrino
into the gateway, acquainted
the guards with the
whole matter, who, in order
to support the jest, would not
seem to see Calandrino as he
passed by them, and were exceedingly
amused to observe
him sweat and groan under
his burdensome load. Without
resting himself in any place,
he proceeded straight to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>own house, which was near the mills, and was neither met nor
seen by any one, as everybody was then at dinner. When he
entered his own house, ready to sink under his burden, his
wife—a handsome and discreet woman of the name of Monna
Tessa—happened to be standing at the head of the stairs,
and being disconcerted and impatient at his long absence,
somewhat angrily exclaimed, “I thought the devil would
never let thee come home! All the city have dined, and
yet we must remain without our dinner.” When Calandrino
heard these words, and found that he was not invisible
to his wife, he fell into a fit of rage, and exclaimed,
“Wretch as thou art, thou hast utterly undone me; but I
will reward thee for it;” and ascending into a small room,
and ridding himself of the stones, he ran down again to
his wife, and seizing her by the hair of the head threw her
on the ground, beat and kicked her in the most unmerciful
manner. Buffalmacco and Bruno, after they had spent
some time in laughter with the guards at the gate, followed
Calandrino at their leisure, and, arriving at his house and
hearing the disturbance upstairs, they called out to him.
Calandrino, still in a furious rage, came to the window and
entreated they would come up to him. They, counterfeiting
great surprise, ascended the stairs, and found the
chamber floor covered with stones and Calandrino’s wife
seated in a corner, her limbs severely bruised, her hair
dishevelled, and her face bleeding; and on the other side
Calandrino himself, weary and exhausted, flung on a chair.
After regarding him for some time, they said, “How
now, Calandrino, art thou building a house, that thou hast
provided thyself with so many loads of stones?” and then
added, “And Monna Tessa—what has happened to her?
You surely have been beating her! What is the meaning of
this?” Calandrino, exhausted with carrying the stones, and
with his furious gust of passion, and moreover, with the
misfortune which he considered had befallen him, could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>collect sufficient spirits to speak a single word in reply.
Whereupon Buffalmacco said further, “Calandrino, if you
have cause for anger in any other quarter, yet you should
not have made such mockery of your friends as you have
done to-day, carrying us out to the plains of Mugnone, like a
couple of fools, and leaving us there without taking leave of
us, or so much as bidding good-day. But, be assured, this
is the last time thou wilt ever serve us in this manner.”
Calandrino, somewhat recovered, replied, “Alas! my
friends, be not offended; the case is very different from
what you think! Unfortunate man that I am! the rare and
precious stone that you speak of, I found, and will relate
the whole truth to you. When you asked each other the
first time what was become of me, I was hard by you, not
more than two yards away; and, perceiving that you saw me
not, I went before you, smiling to myself to hear you vent
your rage upon me;” and recounted all that had happened
on his way home, and, to convince them, showed them
where he was struck on the back and on the heel; and
further added, “As I passed through the gates, I saw you
standing with the guards, but by virtue of the stone I carried
in my bosom, was undiscovered by you all; and in going
through the streets I met many friends and acquaintances,
who are in the daily habit of stopping and conversing with
me, and yet none of them addressed me, as I passed
invisible to them all. But at length arriving at my own
house, this fiend of a woman waiting on the stair-head by ill
luck happened to see me,—and you well know that women
cause all things to lose their virtue,—so that I, who might
have called myself the only happy man in Florence, am now
the most miserable of all. Therefore did I justly beat her,
as long as my strength would allow me, and I know no
reason why I should not yet tear her in a thousand pieces,
for I may well curse the day of our marriage, and the hour
she entered my house.” Buffalmacco and Bruno, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>they heard this, feigned the greatest astonishment, though
they were ready to burst with laughter; but when they saw
Calandrino rise in a rage, with intent to beat his wife again,
they stepped between them, protesting that she was in no
way to blame, but rather he himself, who, knowing beforehand
that women cause all things to lose their virtue, had
not expressly commanded her not to be seen in his presence
all that day, until he had satisfied himself of the real
qualities of the stone; and that, doubtless, Providence had
deprived him of his good fortune, because, though his friends
had accompanied him and assisted in the search, he had
deceived them and not allowed them a share in the benefit
of the discovery. After much more conversation, they with
difficulty reconciled him to his wife, and, leaving him overwhelmed
with grief for the loss of the heliotropium, took
their departure.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>STORY OF DANTE AND THE SMITH.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>When Dante had dined he went out, and passing by
the Porta S. Pietro, heard a blacksmith beating iron
upon the anvil, and singing some of his verses like a song,
jumbling the lines together, mutilating and confusing them,
so that it seemed to Dante he was receiving a great injury.
He said nothing, but going into the blacksmith’s shop, where
there were many articles made in iron, he took up his hammer
and pincers and scales and many other things, and threw
them out into the road. The blacksmith, turning round
upon him, cried out, “What the devil are you doing? are you
mad?” “What are <em>you</em> doing?” said Dante. “I am
working at my proper business,” said the blacksmith, “and
you are spoiling my work, throwing it out into the road.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Said Dante, “If you do not like me to spoil your things,
do not spoil mine.” “What thing of yours am I spoiling?”
said the man. And Dante replied, “You are singing
something of mine, but not as I made it. I have no other
trade but this, and you spoil it for me.” The blacksmith,
too proud to acknowledge his fault, but not knowing how
to reply, gathered up his things and returned to his work;
and when he sang again, sang Tristram and Launcelot, and
left Dante alone.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>MESSER BERNABÒ AND THE MILLER.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Messer Bernabò, Lord of Milan, being outwitted
by the clever reasoning of a miller, bestowed upon
him a valuable benefice. Now this lord was in his time
greatly feared beyond all other rulers, and though he was
cruel, yet was there in his cruelty a great measure of justice.
Among many cases which happened to him was this—that a
rich abbot, for a certain act of negligence (in that he had not
properly fed two hounds belonging to the said lord, and
so had spoilt their tempers), was by him fined 4000 <i><span lang="it">scudi</span></i>.
At this the abbot began to ask for mercy, and the said lord
thereupon said to him: “If thou declarest unto me four
things, I will remit everything; and the things are these—I
will that thou shouldst tell me how far it is from here to
heaven; how much water there is in the sea; what they are
doing in hell; and what is the worth of my person.” The
abbot hearing this began to sigh, and thought himself in
worse plight than before; yet, for the sake of peace and to
gain time, he prayed Bernabò that it would please him to
grant him a term for the answering of such deep questions.
And the lord granted him the whole of the following day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and, as one impatient to hear the end of the matter, made
him give security that he would return. The abbot returned
to his abbey exceeding sorrowful and full of thought,
and puffing and blowing like a frightened horse. When he
had got thither, he met with a miller who was one of his
tenants, and who, seeing him thus afflicted, said: “My
lord, what is the matter, that ye puff and blow on this
wise?” Said the abbot: “I have good cause, for his lordship
is going to be the ruin of me if I do not declare unto
him four things, which neither Solomon nor Aristotle could
do.” Said the miller: “What things are these?” The abbot
told him. Then the miller thought for a while, and said to
the abbot: “Sir, I will get ye out of this strait, an ye will.”
The abbot replied: “Would to God it might be so!”
Said the miller: “I think both God and the saints will be
willing.” The abbot, who knew not what he would be at,
said: “If thou doest it, take from me what thou wilt, for
thou shalt ask me for nothing that I will not give thee, if it
be possible.”... Then said the miller: “I must put on
your tunic and hood, and I will shave my beard, and
to-morrow morning, very early, I will go into his presence,
saying that I am the abbot, and I will settle the four questions
in such a way that I think he will be content.” The
abbot could not wait a moment before he had put the
miller in his place, and so it was done. Early in the morning
the miller set out, and when he had reached the gate of
Bernabò’s house, he knocked and said that such and such
an abbot wished to answer certain questions which the lord
had put to him. The lord, willing to hear what the abbot
had to say, and wondering that he had returned so quickly,
had him called. The miller, coming into his presence
in a room which was not very well lighted, made his
obeisance, holding his hand as much as possible before his
face, and was asked by Bernabò whether he were able to
answer the four questions. And he replied: “My lord,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>I am. Ye asked how far it is from here to heaven;
from this spot it is just thirty-six millions, eight hundred
and fifty-four thousand, seventy-two and a half miles, and
twenty-two paces.” Said Bernabò: “Thou hast given it
very accurately; how wilt thou prove this?” The miller
replied: “Have the distance measured, and if it be not even
as I say, ye may have me hanged by the neck. In the
second place, ye asked how much water there is in the sea.
This was very hard to find out, since it is a thing that is
never still, and there is always more being added; but I
have found out that there are in the sea 25,982,000,000
hogsheads, 7 barrels, 12 gallons, and 2 glasses.” Said the
lord: “How knowest thou this?” The miller answered:
“I reckoned it as well as I could,—if ye do not believe me,
send and fetch barrels, and have it measured. And if it
be not correct, ye may have me quartered. In the third
place, your lordship asked what was being done in hell. In
hell there is hanging, drawing, quartering, and cutting off
of heads going on,—neither less nor more than what your
lordship is doing here.” Bernabò asked: “What reason
dost thou give for this?” He replied: “I have talked with
a man who had been there, and it was from this man Dante
the Florentine heard what he wrote concerning the things of
hell; but this man is dead, and if ye do not believe me,
send and ask him. Fourthly, ye would know what was the
value of your lordship’s person, and I say that it is worth
twenty-nine pence.” When Messer Bernabò heard this, he
turned to him in a fury, saying, “May the plague seize thee!
Dost think I am worth no more than an earthen pipkin?”
The miller replied, and not without great fear: “My Lord,
listen to reason; ye know that our Lord was sold for thirty
pence,—I am surely right in supposing that ye are worth one
penny less than he.” When Bernabò heard this, he imagined
that this man could not be the abbot, and, looking fixedly
at him, perceiving that he was a man of far more sense than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the abbot, he said to him: “Thou art not the abbot.” The
terror which the miller then had, every one may imagine for
himself; he knelt down, and with clasped hands asked for
mercy, telling Bernabò that he was the tenant of the abbey
mill, and how and why he had appeared before him in this
disguise, and that it was rather to please him than from any
ill intention. But Bernabò, hearing this, said: “Well, then,
since he has made thee abbot, and thou art worth more than
he, by the faith of God, I will confirm thee in thine office;
and it is my will that from henceforth thou be the abbot,
and he the miller, and that thou have all the revenue of the
monastery, and he of the mill.” And thus he caused it to
be during all the rest of his life, that the miller should be an
abbot, and the abbot a miller.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>HOW SER NASTAGIO WAS COLLECTED FOR IN CHURCH.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Faustino, of Bologna, was in love with the beautiful
Eugenia, but was unable to meet her on account of
the hostility of her parents, who kept a very strict watch over
her, and debarred her from the very sight of him as much
as they possibly could. Yet her mother, being of a religious
turn of mind, was unwilling that she should relinquish her
usual attendance on divine worship, and herself accompanied
her daughter every morning to hear mass at a church near
their own house, but at so very early an hour that not even
the artisans of the city, much less the young gentry of
the place, were stirring. And there she heard service
performed by a priest expressly on her own account,
though several other persons might happen to be present,
who were in the habit of rising early.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
<img src='images/i_015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Now among these
was a certain corn
merchant named
Ser Nastagio de’
Rodiotti, a man
who had driven
many a hard bargain
and thriven wonderfully
in his trade,
but of so devout a
turn withal that he
would not for the
world have made
an usurious contract,
or even speculated
to any extent,
without having first
attended mass. He
lost not a single
opportunity of
showing himself at
church among the
earliest of the congregation,
and was
ready for business
before a great portion
of his fellow-citizens
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now in a short
time it also reached
the ears of Faustino,
through the good
offices, it is supposed,
of the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>lady, that High Mass was to be heard every morning at a
certain church, with every particular relating to the devotees
who attended, and the nearest way thither. Rejoiced at this
news, her lover now resolved to rise somewhat earlier than
he had been accustomed to do, that he might avail himself
of the same advantage the lady enjoyed, in beginning the
day with religious duties. For this purpose he assumed a
different dress, the better to deceive the eyes of her careful
mother, being perfectly aware that she only made her
appearance thus early with her daughter for the sake of
concealing her from his sight. In this way the young lady
had the merit of bringing Faustino to church, where they
gazed at each other with the utmost devotion, except,
indeed, when the unlucky tradesman just mentioned
happened to place himself, as was frequently the case,
exactly in their way, so as to interrupt the silent communion
of souls. And this he did in so vexatious a
manner that they could hardly observe each other for
a moment without exposing themselves to his searching
eye and keen observation. Greatly displeased at this kind
of inquisition, the lover frequently wished the devout corn
dealer in Purgatory, or that he would at least offer up his
prayers in another church. Such an antipathy did he at
length conceive to Ser Nastagio, that he resolved to employ
his utmost efforts to prevail upon him to withdraw himself
from that spot. He at last hit upon a plan which he
thought sure to succeed, in a manner equally safe and
amusing. He hastened without delay to the officiating
priest, whom he addressed as follows:—“It has ever been
esteemed, my good Messer Pastore, a most heavenly and
laudable disposition to devote ourselves to the relief of
our poorer brethren. And this you doubtless know far
better than I can tell you.... But there are many who,
however destitute, feel ashamed to come forward for the
purpose of begging alms. Now I think that I have of late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>observed one of them in a person who frequents your
church. He was formerly a Jew, but not long ago he
became a Christian, and one whose exemplary life and
conduct render him in all respects worthy of the name.
There is not a more destitute being on the face of the
earth; while such is his modesty that I assure you I have
frequently had the utmost difficulty in persuading him to
accept of alms. It would really be a meritorious act were
you to touch some morning on his cruel misfortunes,
relating his conversion to our faith, and the singular
modesty with which he attempts to conceal his wants.
This would probably procure for him a handsome contribution;
and if you will only have the kindness to apprise
me of the day, I will bring a number of my friends along
with me, and we shall be sure to find this poor fellow seated
in your church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Our kind-hearted priest cheerfully complied with the wily
lover’s request. He proposed the next Sunday morning,
when a large number of people would be present, regretting
that he had not been sooner informed of the affair.
Faustino next gave an exact description of the corn
merchant, observing that the poor man always appeared
neat and clean, so that he could not possibly mistake him.
Then, taking leave of the good friar, he hastened to communicate
this piece of mischief to some of his young
companions. Punctually next Sunday they were at the
church, even early enough to hear the first mass; and
there Messer Nastagio was seen at his usual post, surrounded
by a crowd of people. After going through the
Evangelists and the Creed, and muttering a few Aves, the
good priest paused and looked about him; then, wiping his
forehead, and taking breath for a while, he again addressed
the congregation as follows:—“Dearly beloved brethren,
you must be aware that the most pleasing thing you can do
in the eyes of the Lord is to show your charity towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>poorer Christians.... As I know you are not wanting
in charity, but rather abounding in good works, I am not
afraid to inform you that there is a most deserving yet
destitute object before you, who, though too modest to urge
your compassion, is in every way worthy of it. Pray take
pity upon him. Behold him!” he cried, pointing full at
Ser Nastagio: “Lo! thou art the man. Yes!” he continued,
while the corn merchant stared at him in the utmost
astonishment; “yes, thou art the man! Thy modesty shall
no longer conceal thee from the eyes of the people which
are now fixed upon thee. For though thou wert once an
Israelite, my friend, thou art now one of the lost sheep
which are found, and if thou hast not much temporal, thou
hast a hoard of eternal wealth.” He addressed himself
during the whole of this time, both by words and signs, to
Ser Nastagio, yet the poor merchant could by no means
persuade himself against the evidence of his own reason
that he was the person pointed out. Without stirring,
therefore, he somewhat reluctantly put his hand into his
pocket, preparing to bestow his alms in the same manner as
the rest of the congregation. The first person to present
his contribution was the author of the trick, who, approaching
the spot where the merchant stood, offered his alms,
and, in spite of Ser Nastagio, dropped them into his hat.
And though the incensed tradesman exclaimed, “I have a
longer purse than thou hast ears!” it availed him nothing.
The good priest pursued his theme without noticing Ser
Nastagio’s remark, except by saying, “Give no credit to his
words, good people, but give him alms, give him alms; it is
his modest merit which prevents him from accepting them.
Yes, go thrust them into the good man’s pockets; fill his
hat, his shoes, his clothes with them, and make him bear
away with him the good fruits of your charity.” Then
once more directing his attention to the confused and angry
merchant, he exclaimed, “Do not look thus ashamed, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>take them, take them; for, believe me, good friend, many
greater and better men have been reduced to the same
piteous plight. You should rather consider it as an honour
than otherwise, inasmuch as your necessities have not been
the consequence of your own misconduct, but solely arise
from your embracing the light of truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest had no sooner ended than there was a general
rush of the whole congregation towards the place where the
merchant stood, endeavouring who should be first to deposit
their donations in his hands, while he in vain attempted to
resist the tide of charitable contributions which now poured
in on every side. He had likewise to struggle against his
own avarice, for he would willingly have received the money,
though he did all in his power to repulse their gifts. When
the tumult had a little subsided, Ser Nastagio began to
attack the priest in the most virulent terms, until the
preacher was inclined to suspect that in some way he
had been misinformed. He thus began to make his excuses,
as well as he could, for the error into which he had fallen;
but the lover’s purpose was accomplished, and the deed
could not be recalled. For the story was quickly circulated
through the whole city, to the infinite amusement of all its
inhabitants, and Ser Nastagio was never known to enter
that church again.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>HOW A BARRISTER GOT HIS MONEY’S WORTH.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>In our city there flourished a certain learned advocate, a
member of the great Castello family, Messer Dionisio by
name. Having occasion to enter into the legal arena with
another advocate, whose name I cannot just now recollect,
Messer Dionisio was retained as counsel to Signor Giovanni
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>de’ Bentivogli. The case was tried before our worthy magistrate,
Messer Nicoluzzo de’ Piccoluomini, of Siena; and as it
often happens to these gentlemen of the robe, when deeply
engaged in the interests of their clients, they became so very
personal in the cause of their principals, that at length our
friend’s adversary, unable to bear his bitter taunts, fairly
challenged his honour and veracity, which so incensed
Messer Dionisio that, in a fit of sudden passion, he clenched
his fist and smote his learned antagonist very severely on
the mouth. The presiding magistrate, greatly scandalised at
our friend’s new method of enforcing his arguments, vigorously
remonstrated with him, and threatened to enforce the
full penalty of the law, assuring him that he dealt too mildly
in not committing him on the spot. He would have
executed his menace, had not the high qualities and connections
of Messer Dionisio restrained him. He replied to
the judge’s threats, with the most perfect composure, “Most
noble prætor, according to the tenor of our civil law, I
believe you will only be able to demand about ten pieces
from me;” and putting his hand in his pocket, he drew
forth ten broad gold ducats, saying, “Take only what the
law allows you, and hand me the remainder back.” But the
judge, seizing in a rage upon the whole, cried, “You must
apply elsewhere for the remainder;” which again brought
the angry counsellor upon his legs. Turning quickly round
upon his adversary, now busily employed in repairing the
ruins of his jaws, and uttering fierce exclamations for justice,
our friend again addressed him: “If this be the case, I must
have what I have paid for, over and above;” and he struck
him a more violent blow than before upon his left cheek.
He then addressed the judge: “My lord, you have made
me pay for more than the amount of both the arguments I
have applied in the very face of my learned brother; but
keep the money—he is a pitiful advocate indeed who would
scruple to take advantage of his opponent for the sake of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>ten ducats. I have had my revenge.” And turning his
back upon the court, he left his brother advocate quite
unable to make any reply, and grievously lamenting and
appealing to the magistrate for justice. He was at last
obliged to be patient, for though somewhat incensed the
court could not refrain from indulging a degree of mirth at
Dionisio’s singular arguments. The only sentence obtained
that day in court was, “He who received the injury sustained
all the loss.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE MERRY JESTS OF BUFFALMACCO THE PAINTER.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Buonamico di Cristofano, nicknamed Buffalmacco,
was a pupil of Andrea Tafi, and has been
celebrated as a jester by Boccaccio. Franco Sacchetti also
tells how, when Buffalmacco was still a boy with Andrea, his
master had the habit, when the nights were long, of getting up
before day to work, and calling his boys. This was displeasing
to Buonamico, who had to rise in the middle of his best
sleep, and he considered how he might prevent Andrea from
getting up before day to work, and this was what occurred
to him. Having found thirty great beetles in an ill-kept
cellar, he fastened on each of their backs a little candle, and
at the hour when Andrea was used to rise, he put them one
by one through a hole in the door into Andrea’s chamber,
having first lighted the candles. His master awaking at the
hour for calling Buffalmacco, and seeing the lights, was
seized with terror and began to tremble like a fearful old
man as he was, and to say his prayers and repeat the psalms;
and at last, putting his head under the clothes, he thought
no more that night of calling Buffalmacco, but lay trembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>with fear till daybreak. The morning being come, he asked
Buonamico if, like him, he had seen more than a thousand
devils. Buonamico answered, “No,” for he had kept his
eyes closed, and wondered he had not been called. “What!”
said Tafi, “I had something else to think of than painting,
and am resolved to go into another house.” The next
night, although Buonamico only put three beetles into Tafi’s
chamber, yet he, from the last night’s terror and the fear of
those few devils, could get no sleep at all,
and, as soon as it was day, left the house
determined never to return, and it took a
great deal of good counsel to make him
change his mind. At last Buonamico
brought the priest to him, to console him.
And Tafi and Buonamico discussing the
matter, Buonamico said: “I have always
heard say that demons are the greatest
enemies of God, and consequently they
ought to be the chief adversaries of painters,
because not only do we always make them
hideous, but we also
never cease making
saints on all the walls,
and so cause men in
despite of the devils to
become more and more
devout. So these devils
being enraged against
us, as they have greater
power by night than
by day, they come
playing us these tricks,
and it will be worse if this custom of getting up early is
not quite given up.” With such words Buffalmacco
managed the matter, what the priest said helping him; so
that Tafi left off getting up early, and the devils no longer
went about the house at night with candles. But not many
months after, Tafi, drawn by the desire of gain, and having
forgotten his fears, began afresh to get up early and to call
Buffalmacco; whereon the beetles began again to appear,
until he was forced by his fears to give it up entirely, being
earnestly counselled to do so by the priest. And the matter
being noised abroad in the city for a time, neither Tafi nor
any other painter ventured to get up at night to work.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>While painting the church of the convent of Faenza, at
Florence, Buffalmacco, who was very careless and negligent
in his dress, as in other things, did not always wear his hood
and mantle, as was the fashion at the time; and the nuns,
watching him through the screen they had erected, began to
complain that it did not please them to see him in his
doublet. At last, as he always appeared in the same fashion,
they began to think that he was only some boy employed in
mixing colours; and they gave him to understand, through
their abbess, that they should prefer to see his master,
and not always him. To this Buonamico answered good-humouredly
that when the master came he would let them
know, understanding, nevertheless, how little confidence
they had in him. Then he took a stool, and placed upon it
another, and on the top he put a pitcher or water-jug, and
fastened a hood on the handle, and covered up the rest of
the jug with a cloak, fastening it well behind the tables;
and having fixed a pencil in the spout of the jug, he went
away. The nuns coming again to see the picture through a
hole that they had made in the screen, saw the supposed
master in his fine attire, and not doubting that he was
working with all his might, doing very different work from
what that boy did, for several days were quite content. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>last, being desirous to see what fine things the master had
done in the last fortnight (during which time Buonamico
had not been there at all), one night, thinking he was gone,
they went to see his picture, and were overcome with confusion
when one more bold than the rest detected the solemn
master, who during the fortnight had done no work at all.
But, acknowledging that he had only treated them as they
deserved, and that the work which he had done was worthy
of praise, they sent their steward to call Buonamico back;
and he with great laughter went back to his work, letting
them see the difference between men and water-jugs, and that
it does not always do to judge a man’s work by his clothes.
So in a few days he finished a picture with which they
were greatly pleased, except that the faces seemed to them
to be too pale and wan. Buonamico having heard this, and
knowing that the Abbess had some wine which was the best
in Florence, told them that if they wished to remedy the
defect, it could only be done by mixing the colours with
good wine; and then if the cheeks were touched with the
colour, they would become red and of a more lively aspect.
The good sisters hearing this, and ready to believe everything,
kept him always supplied with excellent wine while he
worked; and he, while enjoying the wine himself, to please
them, made his colours more fresh and bright.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>I have not been able to get a wink of sleep to-night, for
wondering how Callimaco and the rest have been getting
on. I have been trying to pass the time, while waiting, by
attending to various matters. I said the morning prayers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>read a chapter of the <cite>Lives of the Holy Fathers</cite>, went into
church and lit a lamp which had gone out, and changed the
veil of a statue of the Madonna which works miracles.
How many times have I told the monks to keep that image
clean? And then they wonder why there is a lack of
devotion! I remember the time when there were five
hundred images here, and now there are not twenty. This
is all our own fault; we have not been able to keep up the
reputation of the place. We used to go in procession after
service every evening, and have the Lauds sung every
Saturday. We always made vows here, so as to get fresh
images, and we used to encourage the men and women who
came to confession to make vows likewise. Nowadays none
of these things are done, and we are astonished that there
is so little enthusiasm! What an amazingly small quantity
of brains these monks of mine have among them!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE MEDIÆVAL UNDERGRADUATE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>There was once at Padua a Sicilian scholar called
Pontius, who seeing one day a countryman with a pair
of fat fowls, pretending that he wanted to buy them, made a
bargain with him and said, “Come home with me, and over
and above the price I will give thee some breakfast.” So he
led him to a place where there was a bell-tower, which is
separate from the church, so that one can go all round it; and
opposite one of the four faces of the Campanile was the end of
a little street. Here Pontius, having first thought of what he
wished to do, said to the countryman: “I have wagered these
fowls with one of my comrades, who says that this tower is
certainly forty feet in circumference; and I say no. So just
at that moment when I met you I had been buying this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>string to measure it with; and before we go home, I want
to ascertain which of us has won.” Thus saying, he took the
string out of his sleeve, and gave one end of it to the countryman
to hold, and saying, “Give here!” he took the fowls
from him, and holding the other end of the string, began to
go round the tower, as if to measure it, making the countryman
stop on that side of the tower which was opposite the
end of the little street. When he had reached this side he
drove a nail into the wall and tied the string to it, and thus
leaving it, went off quietly down the street with the fowls.
The countryman remained for a great space of time, waiting
till he should have finished measuring; but at last, when he
had several times said, “What are you doing so long?” he
went to see, and found that the one who held the string was
not Pontius, but a nail driven into the wall, which was
all that remained to him as payment for the fowls.</p>

it be made big enough to hold both.” And thus, although

<p class='c008'>... <span class='c014'>N</span>ow Astolfo was
conducted by
his guide into a narrow
valley between two steep
mountains. And in this
place there was miraculously
collected together
everything which gets lost
on earth, either through
some failing of our own, or by the fault of time or fortune.
I mean not only riches and power, but also those things
which fortune alone can neither give nor take away. Many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>a reputation lies up there, which time, like a moth, has long
been gnawing at here below, and also numberless vows and
good resolutions made by sinners. There we should find
the tears and sighs of lovers, the time lost in gaming, all
the wasted leisure of ignorant men, and all vain intentions
which have never been put into action. Of fruitless desires
there are so many that they lumber up the greater part
of that place. In short, whatever you have lost here below
you will find again if you ascend thither.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our Paladin, as he passed along, now and again asking
questions of his guide, saw a mountain of blown bladders,
which seemed to be full of noise inside. And he knew
that these were the ancient crowns of the Assyrians, and of
Lydia, and of the Persians and Greeks, which once were
famous, while now their very names are almost forgotten.
Close by he saw great masses of gold and silver piled up in
heaps, which were those gifts that people made, in hopes of
getting a reward, to kings and princes. He saw wreaths
of flowers with traps hidden among them, and heard, in
asking, that they were flatteries. Verses that men made in
praise of their patrons are seen there, under the form of
grasshoppers, who have hurt themselves with chirping....
He saw many broken bottles of different kinds, and found
that they stand for the service men pay to courts, and the
thanks they get for it. Then he came to a great pool of
spilt broth, and asking what it was, his guide told him that
it represented the alms people direct to be given after their
deaths. Then he passed by a great heap of various flowers,
which once were sweet-scented, but now have a foul odour;
this was the gift (if we may be permitted to say so) that
Constantine bestowed on the good Pope Sylvester.</p>

<p class='c009'>He saw a great quantity of twigs covered with bird-lime,
there, O fair ladies, are your beauty! He saw&#160;... but it
would be an endless task to count up the things which were
shown him there. The only thing he did not find was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>folly: that remains here on earth, for no one ever parts
with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last he came to that which we are all so firmly
persuaded we possess, that no one ever prayed to have it
given him—I mean common sense. There was a huge heap
of it, as big as all the other things put together. It was like
a clear, soft liquid, which easily evaporates if it is not kept
tightly corked, and was contained in bottles of various
shapes and sizes, each one being labelled with the name
of its owner. Astolfo noticed one which was much larger
than the rest, and read on the label, “<em>Orlando’s Wits</em>.” He
saw also a great part of his own; but what made him
marvel more than anything was the fact that many people
whom he had believed to have plenty of sense were now
shown to have little or none, the bottles marked with their
names being nearly full. Some lose it through love, others
in striving after honours; yet others, in seeking for riches
by land and sea, or by putting their trust in great lords and
princes, or in pursuing after follies of magic and sorcery,
or gems or pictures, or anything else which a man values
above others. There was a great quantity of the wits of
philosophers and astrologers stored there, and also of those
of poets. Astolfo took up his own, having received permission
to do so, and put the flask to his nose; and it
appears that his wits returned to their place right enough,
for Turpin confesses that from thenceforth Astolfo lived
very wisely indeed for a long time. But afterwards, it is
true, he made one mistake which once more deprived him
of his brains. Then he took up the large flask which contained
Orlando’s, and which was no light weight, and turned
to depart....</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>When I made this speech, there was present that
gentleman of Cardinal Santa Fiore’s with whom I had
had words, and confirmed to the Pope all that had been told
him! The Pope remained swelling with rage, and said
nothing. Now I do <em>not</em> wish to fail in stating my reasons
in a just and righteous manner. That gentleman of Santa
Fiore’s came to me one day, and brought me a little ring
all tarnished with quicksilver, saying, “Burnish this ring for
me, and make haste about it.” I had a great many pieces
of goldsmith’s work in hand, with most valuable jewels
waiting to be set, and hearing myself, moreover, ordered
about with so much assurance by a man whom I had never
seen or spoken to before, answered that I had not a burnisher
by me just then, and that he had better go to
another. He, without any reason in the world, told me
that I was an ass. To these words of his I replied that he
did not speak the truth, and that I was a man, on every
account worth more than he; but that, if he bothered me,
I would certainly kick harder than any ass. He went
straight to the cardinal, and made out that I had all but
murdered him. Two days after this I was shooting behind
the palace at a wild pigeon, which had its nest in a hole,
very high up; and that same pigeon I had seen shot at
by a goldsmith named Giovan Francesco della Tacca, a
Milanese, who had never hit it. On the day when I was
shooting, it had become shy, and scarcely showed its head;
and because this Giovan Francesco and I were rival marksmen,
certain gentlemen and friends of mine who were in
my workshop pointed it out to me, and said, “That is
Tacca’s pigeon which he has so often shot at. See, the
poor bird has grown suspicious, and scarcely shows its
head.” I looked up, and said, “It shows quite enough for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>me to hit it, if I only had time to take aim first.” Those
gentlemen said that the man himself who invented the firelock
could never hit it. I replied I was willing to wager a
pitcher of the best Greek wine that I would do so; and,
taking aim, and shooting from the arm, without any support
for my piece, I did what I had promised, without thinking
of the cardinal or anybody else; nay, I had the less reason
to do so, as I believed the cardinal to be very much my
patron. Thus may the world see what divers ways Fortune
takes, when she wishes to be the ruin of a man. To return
to the Pope: he remained, all swollen and sulky, brooding
over what he had heard....</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>When we had passed the Mount Simplon aforesaid, we
found a river near a place called Indevedro. This
river was very wide and rather deep, and crossed by a little
narrow bridge without a parapet. There was a hard frost
that morning, and when I reached the bridge—for I was in
front of the rest, and saw that it was very dangerous—I
ordered my young men and the servants to dismount, and
lead their horses by the bridle. Thus I passed the said
bridge in safety, and went on talking with one of those two
Frenchmen, who was a gentleman. The other was a notary,
who had remained somewhat behind, and jeered at that
gentleman and at me, saying that for fear of nothing at all
we had preferred the discomfort of going on foot; to whom
I turned, and seeing him on the middle of the bridge,
prayed him to come softly, for that it was a very dangerous
place. This man, who could not help showing his French
nature, said to me in French that I was a man of little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>courage, and that there was no danger at all. While he
was saying these words he pricked his horse with the spur,
through which means it suddenly slipped over the edge of
the bridge, and fell close beside a large stone, turning over
with its legs in the air; and as God very often shows compassion
to fools, this beast, along with the other beast, his
horse, fell into a great and deep hole, wherein both he and his
horse went under water. As soon as I saw this I began to
run, and with great difficulty leaped upon the stone aforesaid,
and, holding on by it and hanging over the brink, I
seized the edge of a gown which that man was wearing, and
by that gown I pulled him up, while he was still under
water; and because he had drunk a great quantity of water,
and within a little would have been drowned, I, seeing him
out of danger, told him I was rejoiced at having saved his
life. Whereat he answered me that I had done nothing—that
the most important thing were his parchments, which
were worth much money. It seemed that he spoke thus
in anger, all soaked through as he was, and muttering
confusedly. At this I turned to the guides we had with us,
and promised to pay them if they would help this beast.
One of the guides valorously, and with great difficulty, set
himself to do what he could, and fished up all the parchments,
so that he lost nothing; the other would not put
himself to any trouble to help him....</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>FROM A LETTER TO PIER MARIA BALDI.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Buffalmacco was a famous painter in his day;
and in my judgment—and I am not altogether a
fool in these matters—he still deserves to be preferred to
Titian and the divine Michael Angelo—and one can go no
further than that. If you wish, Signor Baldi, to know the
reasons and motives of this judgment of mine, do not expect
me to say that Buffalmacco was so skilled and perfect a
master as to be able to teach the art of painting in its
greatest refinements to an ape which the Bishop of Arezzo
kept for his pastime; but I shall certainly tell you that
Buffalmacco was he who discovered that noble and ever-to-be-remembered
and ever-to-be-praised invention of tempering
colours, not with water from the well, but with the most
brilliant white wine that could ever be produced by the best
shoots of the most renowned vines on the Florentine hills.
Before Buffalmacco had made this discovery, he used to
execute paintings which—you may rely upon it—were
exactly like your own face; that is to say, pale, washed-out,
and mouldy-looking; and in many of them I fancy I
recognise my own portrait, with a face like a mummy, thin,
dry, hollow-cheeked, worn to a shadow, and coloured with a
certain hue like that of bread-crust or a quince baked in the
oven, and so melancholy as to make people weep who were
quite ready to laugh. But when this great master of all
masters began to use wine with his colours—</p>
<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_048f.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>

      <div class='line'>With fresh, blooming faces, all milk and roses!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>and they were all the right sort of folk—jovial, cheerful,
wholesome, and good-tempered, so that people talked about
them even as far as the gates of Paris, and the ladies of
Faenza—certain knowing nuns, whose convent stood where
the lower fort is now—had more faith in Buffalmacco than
in all the Apelleses and Protogeneses who were in credit
with the ancient Greeks. Now, what do I mean by all this
screed of nonsense? I mean to draw the conclusion, that
since you are so kind as to draw the illustrations to that book
of mine, you will most assuredly come to grief unless you
mix your colours with <em>Vernaccia</em> or some other good wine,
and you will do no work that is worth looking at. And
since it is not right that you should be at any expense in
consequence of this work of mine, I send you a sample of
white wine of Syracuse, with other samples of wine given me
by his Serene Highness the Grand Duke; with which, if you
mix your colours, you will not only give a good appearance
to your pictures, but also get back your former healthy looks,
in spite of those disgusting messes which you are made to
swallow, every morning, by those two physicians, your friends.
Try this new prescription, and you will soon be well.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>A BERGAMASC PETER PEEBLES.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A certain Bergamasc, an honest fellow, and ignorant
as a log, came up here some years ago, with five or
six thousand scudi in cash. He at once encountered certain
astute rustics, who, making him believe that black was
white, and dazzling him with the most extraordinary
promises, soon succeeded in borrowing the greater part of
his money. Now, alleging as excuses, sometimes storms,
sometimes drought, and then again thunder and lightning,
they have managed so to spin out matters that the poor
man cannot get back a farthing of his money to this day.
Do not imagine, however, that this difficulty causes him any
sorrow; on the contrary, it gives him the greatest delight in
the world, for it has opened up to him the possibility of
unlimited law-suits—a prospect as dear to his heart as sugar
to flies. And, not content with civil suits, he worried so
long at his debtors that, at last, one of them—better at
paying up than the rest—attempted to pay his whole debt
at a blow, which he did with a scythe, on the top of the
creditor’s head. It was well for him that the blow did not
reach the neck, at which it was aimed, and which it would
have cut through like a stalk of clover; but glanced off
on the forehead, only wounding the skin. You never saw
greater joy than he experienced when he felt the blood
running down his face, and made sure of it by putting up
his hand. I think he would have died of sheer satisfaction,
had his delight not been tempered by the disappointed
reflection that, after all, he had not had his skull broken.
He went off at once to find me,—and, nearly frightening me
out of my wits with his ensanguined countenance, shouted,
“I am going. I am off to Venice this minute! Give me
an introduction to an honest solicitor!” I, seeing the state
he was in, thought he was wandering in his mind, and that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>instead of a solicitor, he meant to ask for a surgeon. But
when I had heard what had happened, and understood what
his intention was, I promised to do what he asked, and so
far pacified him that he allowed the steward’s wife to dress
his head with a little white-of-egg and tow, and bandage it
with a piece of rag. Then he insisted on telling me his
story all over again, and how fortunate he was in having
another plea to enter;—he would not, he said, part with his
broken head for several ducats—in fact, he was quite ready
to pay his debtor a dozen ducats or so for the favour done
him. Now, having got together all his documents, and,
further, written out on a sheet of paper, in the Bergamasc
dialect, the whole history of the quarrel—a curious and
valuable manuscript—he is coming to Venice, to get legal
advice about it, and be directed how to get back his own,
by means of his broken head. Here he is, then, with his
spurs on, like a fighting-cock, and I have charged him with
this present letter to you; so please to send him to some
man with a conscience, who may try and help him get back
his money, and also persuade him that he will do well to
leave this part of the country—for it is ill jesting with our
farmers, and if he tries it, he will soon find himself skinned.
I recommend him to you most earnestly, because he is in
the right,—because he is a good fellow by nature,—and
because of his shocking ignorance. Before sending him to
the solicitor, get him to tell you a little about his litigations.
I promise you that you will hear words which all the
commentators on the Pandects would never have discovered.
Besides this, he begins to speak in a big bass voice which
gradually rises and ends in a falsetto, so that his conversation
is a species of music. His eloquence and arrangement
of facts are something marvellous; he will begin by telling
you of his broken head, and his disputes with the farmers;
he will then go on to say that he has lent them money, and
end up by telling you that he was from Bergamo. In short,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>he begins with the death, and goes backwards till he gets to
the christening. When you find him a lawyer, be sure, in
the first place, to choose one who understands stories told
upside down. Help him all you can, and let me know what
you think of him when you see him. Good-bye.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>HOW TO SUCCEED IN LITERATURE.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>In those old-fashioned times, when people lived, so to
speak, at haphazard, and when, if a man wished to gain
a reputation for learning, he forgot himself and all he had
and stuck to his books day and night—the ways of acquiring
for one’s self an honoured and illustrious name were very
different from what they are now. But in those days the
business was a long one, and the path to be trodden was
steep and rugged; and few were those who reached the top
of the mountain, where Learning sheds abroad her gifts and
graces. In our own day, however, we have shortened the
journey, and opened a level and easy road, wherein you may
walk, as it were, on cotton, with no other trouble than that
of elbowing back those rival competitors who are pressing
forward too boldly, or firing a snap-shot at those who are
spreading their wings too rapidly. If any young man wishes
to get on quickly, and to be greatly honoured, let him lay up
a good store of <i><span lang="fr">mots</span></i> and jests against his rivals, and have his
head so full of them that they may fall from his tongue in
showers like hailstones; and let him utter them on every
possible occasion, whether in or out of season does not
matter. Let him remember, moreover, that it is not enough
to speak ill of others, but that he must also speak well of
himself, and remember that Horace and Ovid, both of them,
said that neither time, nor fire, nor any other calamity could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>destroy their works out of the world. If he cannot imitate
those two writers in any other respect, let him do it in this.
He should not spend much time and labour in composition,
but dash off everything in hot haste; for the file and the
foot-rule will spoil all the fire of his writing. Once upon a
time the great art was to use art and yet conceal it; nowadays,
in order to make no mistake in the using of it, it is
considered the safest thing to have none at all. Those who
are considered good authors he should leave alone, otherwise
he may be accused of plagiarism; let him make capital
of himself and his own brain, and fly wherever the latter is
disposed to carry him. These are the general principles
through following which I promise eternal fame to the
young man in question. It is true that in this way a man
does not leave a great literary reputation behind him after
his death;—but what matters this last vanity, or the glory of
an epitaph either?</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Jove, having one day drank more nectar than usual, and
being in a pleasant humour, the fancy took him to
make some present to mankind. And having called Momus,
he gave him what he had decided upon, packed in a portmanteau,
and sent him down to the earth. “Oh!” cried
Momus (when he arrived in a chariot) to the human race,
“Oh! truly blessed generation. Behold how Jove, liberal
of his benefits towards you, opens his generous hand!
Come, hasten, receive! Never complain again that he has
made you short-sighted. His gift quite compensates you for
this defect.” So saying, he unfastened the portmanteau, and
emptied out of it an enormous heap of spectacles. Behold,
then, the whole of mankind busy picking them up; every
man has his pair—all are content, and thank Jove for having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>acquired so excellent an aid to their eyesight. But the
spectacles caused them to see things under a deceitful
appearance. To one man a thing seems blue, while another
sees it yellow; one thinks it is white, and another black, so
that to every one it appears different. But what of that?
Every individual was delighted with his pair, and quite taken
up with it, and insisted on its being the best. My dear
friends, we are the heirs of these people, and the spectacles
have fallen to our lot. Some see things one way, and some
another, and every one thinks he is right.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE FIRST HOUR AND THE SUN.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><em>First Hour.</em> Good morning, your Excellency.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> Yes, or rather good-night.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First Hour.</em> The horses are ready.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> Very good.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First Hour.</em> The morning star has been out some time.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> Very good—let her come or go as it suits her.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First Hour.</em> What does your Excellency mean?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> I mean that I want you to leave me alone.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First Hour.</em> But, your Excellency, the night has already
lasted so long that it cannot last any longer,—and if we were
to wait, you see, your Excellency, it might give rise to some
disorder.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> Let come of it what will—I shall not move.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First Hour.</em> Oh! your Excellency, what is this? don’t you
feel well?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> No, no—I don’t feel anything, except that I don’t
want to move, so you may go about your business.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First Hour.</em> How can I go, if you do not come?—for I am
the first hour of the day. And how can there be any day at
all if your Excellency does not deign to come out as usual?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> If you are not the first hour of the day, you can be
the first hour of the night; or else the night hours can go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>on double duty, and you and your companions may take it
easy. Because—I tell you what it is: I am tired of this continual
going round and round in order to give light to a few
wretched little animals living on a handful of mud, so small
that I, though I have pretty good sight, cannot manage to
see it. So this night I have made up my mind that I can’t
be bothered any more; and if men want light, let them keep
their fires burning, or provide it in some other way.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_064.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>First Hour.</em> But how does your Excellency expect the poor
wretches to manage it? And then it will be an enormous
expense for them to keep up their lamps and provide candles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>enough to burn all day long. If they had already discovered
that kind of air which will burn, and could use it to light up
their streets, and rooms, and shops, and cellars, and everything
else—and all at a small expense—why, then I should
say that the thing was not so bad. But the fact is, that it
will be three hundred years, more or less, till men find out
that expedient; and in the meantime they will get to the
end of all the oil, and wax, and pitch, and tallow, and have
nothing more to burn.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> Let them go and catch fireflies, or those little worms
which shine in the dark.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First Hour.</em> And how will they provide against the cold?—for
without the help they have had from you the wood of all
the forests will never be enough to warm them. Besides
which they will also die of hunger; for the earth will no
longer yield its fruits. And so, at the end of a few years, the
race of those poor animals will be entirely lost. They will
crawl about for a time, groping in the dark after something
to eat and warm themselves at; and, in the end, when the
last spark of fire has died out, and they have eaten everything
that a human being could possibly swallow, they will
all die in the dark, frozen hard like bits of rock crystal.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> And if they do, what business is that of mine? Am
I the nurse of the human race?—or perhaps their cook, who
has to provide and prepare their food for them? What is it
to me that a certain small quantity of invisible animalcules,
thousands of miles distant from me, cannot see, or bear the
cold, without my light? Besides, even though it were my
duty to serve as stove or hearth, so to speak, to this human
family, it is surely reasonable that, if the family want to warm
themselves, they should come and stand round the stove—not
that the stove should walk round the house. And so, if the
earth has need of my presence, let her bestir herself, and see
that she gets it; for, as far as I am concerned, I want nothing
of her, and there is no reason why I should go after her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span><em>First Hour.</em> Your Excellency means, if I understand aright,
that what you did formerly is now to be done by the Earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sun.</em> Yes, now—and henceforward for ever.</p>

Madam Death!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Death.</em> Wait till my time comes,
and I’ll come without your calling.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> Madam Death!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> Go!—and the Devil go with you! I shall
come fast enough when you don’t want me.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> As if I were not immortal!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> Immortal? Past is already the thousandth
year since the days of the immortals were
ended.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> Why, madam, you are talking in the
manner of Petrarch, as though you were a lyric
poet of the sixteenth—or the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> I am very fond of Petrarch’s rhymes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>because there is my <em>Triumph</em> among them, and the rest of
them are nearly all about me too. But, anyway, get out of
my sight at once.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> Come—for the love you bear to the seven deadly sins,
stop a little, and look at me.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> I am looking at you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> Don’t you know me?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> You ought to know that my sight is not good, and
that I cannot use spectacles, because the English do not
make any that would serve me—and even though they made
them, I have no nose to put them on.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> I am Fashion, your sister.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> My sister?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> Yes—don’t you remember that we are both daughters
of Decadence?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> What should I remember, whose business it is to
destroy all memory?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> But I do, and I know that we are both equally busy,
continually undoing and changing the things of this world,
although you set about this task in one way, and I in another.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> If you are not talking to your own thoughts, or to
some person whom you have inside your throat, do raise
your voice a little, and pronounce your words more clearly;
for if you go on mumbling between your teeth with that thin
cobweb of a voice of yours, I shall take till to-morrow to hear
you. My hearing, as you know, is no better than my sight.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> Although it is not exactly usual,—and in France
people do not speak in order to be heard,—yet, as we are
sisters, and can drop ceremony between ourselves, I will
speak as you wish. I say that the nature and custom of
both of us is continually to ruin the world; but you, from
the beginning, have thrown yourself on the person and the
blood, whereas I mostly content myself with beards, hair,
clothes, furniture, palaces, and such-like. It is true that I
have not failed to carry on certain games which may well be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>compared to yours—as, for instance, piercing holes in ears,
lips, or noses,—burning the flesh of men with red-hot irons,
with which I make them mark themselves for the sake of
beauty,—forming the heads of babies by means of bandages
and other contrivances, so that all the people in a country
may have heads of the same shape, as I have done in Africa
and in America,—laming people with narrow shoes,—choking
the breath out of them, and making their eyes start
out of their heads with the tightness of their stays,—and a
hundred other things of the same kind. Not only so, but,
generally speaking, I persuade and force all people of any
position to bear unending fatigue and discomfort, every
day of their lives—oftentimes pain and torture; and some of
them will even die gloriously for the love they bear to me.
I say nothing of the headaches, chills, colds of every kind,—daily,
tertian, and quartan fevers, which men get through
obeying me,—submitting to shiver with cold and be suffocated
with heat, as I please,—to cover their bodies with
woollen stuff, and their chests with linen, and do everything
in the way I tell them, even though it be to their own hurt.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> Well,—I am quite willing to believe that you are my
sister, and, if you wish to have it so, I will consider it more
certain than death—and you need not prove it out of the
parish register. But if I stand still in this way, I turn
faint; yet, if you have courage to run alongside of me, take
care not to kill yourself, as I go at a great pace. If you can
run you can tell me all you have to say as we go along; if
not, I must leave you with a salutation, and promise you,
in consideration of our relationship, to leave you all my
property when I die.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> If we had to run a race together, I don’t know which
of us would win; for if you run, I do more than gallop.
And as for standing still in one place,—if in turns you faint,
it kills me. So then, let us run together, and, as you say,
speak of our affairs as we go.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><em>D.</em> Let it be so. Since, then, you are my sister, it
would be the right thing if you could help me somehow or
other in my business.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> I have already done so, more than you think. In the
first place, though I am continually destroying or changing
all other customs, I have never in any place induced people
to leave off dying; and for this reason, you see, the practice
has universally remained in force from the beginning of the
world up to the present day.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> It is a mighty miracle that you should not have done
what you cannot do.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> What I cannot do? You do not seem to know the
power of fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> Well, well—it will be time to talk about this when the
fashion of not dying has come in. But meanwhile, I should
like you, as a good sister, to help me to obtain the contrary
result more easily and quickly than I have hitherto done.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>F.</em> I have already told you of some of my work which is
very profitable to you. But that is a trifle in comparison
with what I am going to tell you. For your sake I have
gradually—especially in the later times—caused people to
disuse and forget the exercises which are beneficial to
health, and brought in other customs which weaken the
body and shorten life. Besides which, I have introduced
into the world such rules and customs, that life itself, as well
for the body as the soul, is rather dead than alive, so that
this century may truly be called the Age of Death....
Besides, whereas formerly you used to be hated and abused,
nowadays, thanks to me, things have reached such a pass,
that whoever has any intellect at all values and praises you,
preferring you above life, and turns his eyes to you as to
his greatest hope. Finally, seeing that many had made
their boast of living after death in the memories of their
fellow-men,&#160;... I have abolished this habit of seeking
after immortality, and of conferring it in case there should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>be any who deserved it.... These things, which are
neither few nor small, I have, up to now, accomplished for
the love of you, wishing to increase your state and power on
earth, as has, in fact, been the case. I am disposed to do
as much as this, and more, every day, and it was with this
intention I set out to seek you; and I think it would be
well that, for the future, we should remain together. Thus
we could lay our plans better than formerly, and also carry
them out more effectually.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D.</em> You speak truly; and I am quite willing we should
do so.</p>

and points out a low pot-house, with a green branch for a
sign, where every one is welcome. Here too, however, he
is contemptuously received. The landlord looks at the dust
on his boots, and hesitates about admitting him; the
chambermaids address him, not as “Sir,” but as “You,
there!” and when dinner is served he is not asked to sit
down to table.]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Well done! Signor Grossi! Well done, indeed! Your
lordship is over there enjoying yourself; and nobody
even dreams of talking about a poor wretch like me, who is
neither here nor there. But don’t you feel a singing in
your ears from morning to night? You, I mean, you lazy,
luxurious, thankless, forgetful wretch! Is it so much
trouble to write on a piece of paper, “I am well—the family
ditto, and we all remember you”? Is this what comes of
your having a good time—eh? Now my gentleman is at
Bellano, in his own house, away from everything that can
possibly worry him, surrounded with every earthly blessing,
and thinks he has the Pope in his pocket.... As for his
friends, they are “out of sight, out of mind,” with him. Only
let me come to Milan again, and you shall see. If ever you
dare to try your old tricks again in my presence, I shall
say to you, with a face a yard long—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let Signor Grossi hook!</div>
      <div class='line'>On him I will not look (<i><span lang="la">facit indignatio versum</span></i>).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>But, joking apart, what infernal airs are these you are
giving yourself in not answering? Are all the pens used in
your house made of lead? I, who am one of the laziest men
living under the vault of heaven, have written you people
letters upon letters, and you are no more to be moved than so
many blocks. Only M. has had pity on me; but he is so
upset on account of a certain promise of ——’s, that, out of
a page and a half of letter, there were only about three lines
for me. But even this is something, and something is
better than nothing. But against <em>you</em> I have a grudge—one
big enough to make me do something outrageous....</p>

<p class='c009'>I ought not to say so—because not one of the whole lot
of you deserves it—but the parting from you threw me into a
deep melancholy, which still continues. My liver, or some
other fiend who has his dwelling under the ribs, has again
got out of order,—and no one knows how much trouble it
will give me before getting right again. If I had to endure
another winter like the last, Job might be said to have lived
and died in the greatest comfort in comparison with me. I
do not wish to have anything more to do with doctors—I
have always found them just like the fog, which leaves the
weather as it finds it. I trust in the climate of Pisa, and if
there is anything that I wish for, it is a little bottle of
“<em>Never-mind-it</em>,” which is a medicine good for many diseases.
Though, I think, when one has it, one must prepare it for
himself, and measure out his own doses; and I have
never been a skilled apothecary as regards this particular
drug. On the contrary, it has always been a failing of
mine to thrust my head too deeply into the affairs of
this ridiculous world,—and my own, which are the most
ridiculous of all,—and once in, it is no easy matter to get it
out again. How many times I have made up my mind to
think only of myself, and let things go as they like! and
every time I do so, this idiotic heart, which, through no
fault of my own, I have to drag about with me, has made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>me look like a fool of the first magnitude. Certainly it is
quite evident that I was intended by nature for burlesque;
since every time I have taken a thing seriously, I have been
sure, sooner or later, to act the harlequin before my own eyes.
So that now, whenever I have to do with worthy people
who are firm and solid, and (so to speak) all in one
piece, I am always secretly in dread lest one day or other
they should belie their natures and turn out the veriest
quicksilver. Do you know that in the end it really
cannot be such a very great misfortune to leave this puppetshow
that they call life? Surely it cannot be that we shall
have people playing Punch and Judy tricks in the other
world! Either we shall all have become wise, or at least, if
we are destined to carry with us a grain or so of folly and
ridiculousness, I do believe that we shall be permitted to
divide into sets according to our own particular fancy.
And, look you, if, when I have arrived up there, I happen
to see two or three men that I know of, I shall join that
clique at once, and stay there <i><span lang="la">per omnia sæcula sæculorum</span></i>.
With these certain ones I should hope that (the weakness of
our mortal nature being once left behind) a thing once
said would be looked upon as settled, and that we should
have an end of—</p>

      <div class='line'><em>No</em>, this morning, sir, I say!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But I hope you understand that I want neither you nor
Sandrino Manzoni near me, either in this world or the
next; for I shall never forget the way you have treated
me, letting me go without so much as a “Good-bye”—not
even a “<em>Go and be hanged to you.</em>” I have made a
note of it, and shall remember it against you till Doomsday.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why is it that rascals like you can always put honest men
in the wrong? In the very act of closing this letter I receive
yours of the 2nd! Well, well, that is not so bad, but I
have yet to see Manzoni’s; and you, by promising it, have
done me more harm than good.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Let us hope that our dear Alessandro Manzoni (who,
by-the-bye, is a——; never mind, I won’t write it!) will
be able to come to Pisa with Donna Teresa and Vittorina.
Apropos of Vittorina, is it true that she has not been well
of late? Arconati told me she had a cold when she left:
I should be very sorry to think she was suffering from
anything worse. Remember me to every one, not forgetting
our friends Torti and Rossari; I have been going to write
to them over and over again. I am glad to hear you are
all well at home; were it not that I am still angry with you
for that silence of a month and more, I should be inclined
to tell you that you deserve this and every other good
fortune. Well, good-bye, you rascal, and since there are
some wrongs for which it is useless to claim compensation,
I may as well send you my love.</p>

<p class='c009'>P.S.—As for work, I have a great number of irons in the
fire, but I am terribly afraid my stock of wood will not last
long enough to heat them. When a perfect anarchy of
plans and projects comes to life in my brain, this is a sign
that it is not a time for finishing anything at all at all.
Meanwhile, I shall dawdle along, reading this and that, as
it happens,—and when the hour for production strikes, I
shall produce.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>[Don Abbondio, a village priest, walking by himself in a lonely place, sees two bravoes waiting for him in a narrow lane.]</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>... <span class='c014'>H</span>e quickened his pace, recited a verse in a louder
tone, composed his countenance to all the calm and cheerfulness
he could summon up for the moment, made every
effort to prepare a smile, and when he found himself right
in front of the two swashbucklers, he ejaculated, mentally,
“Now we’re in for it!” and stopped short.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your Reverence!” said one of the two, looking him full
in the face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who wants me?” replied Don Abbondio, raising his
eyes from his book, and holding it open in both hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You intend,” pursued the other, with the threatening
and angry look of a man who has caught his inferior in
the commission of a crime—“you intend to perform the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>ceremony of marriage, to-morrow, between Renzo Tramaglino
and Lucia Mondella.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is&#160;...” answered Don Abbondio, in a quavering
voice—“that is&#160;... gentlemen, you are men of the world,
and you know how these matters take place. The poor
priest has nothing whatever to say in the business; they
arrange everything between themselves, and then&#160;... then
they come to us, as you would come to a bank to draw out
your money, and we—well, we are the servants of the
congregation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then,” said the bravo, in an undertone, but with
an impressive air of command, “this marriage is not to take
place, either to-morrow, or at any other time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, gentlemen,” expostulated Don Abbondio, in the
meek and gentle voice of a man trying to persuade an impatient
listener—“but, gentlemen, do be good enough to
put yourselves in my place. If the thing depended on me,
now&#160;... you see perfectly well that it matters nothing to
me, one way or the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come!” interrupted the bravo; “if the business had to
be settled by talk, you would have us all, in a moment. We
know nothing more about it, and do not want to. A man
warned&#160;... you understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, gentlemen, you are too just, too reasonable——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” interrupted the second bravo, who now spoke for
the first time—“but either the marriage will not take place,
or—or the man who performs it will not repent of doing so,
because he will not have time, and——” he finished off his
sentence with a good round oath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” returned the first speaker; “his Reverence
knows the ways of the world; and we are gentlemen, and
do not want to do him any harm, if he will only have a little
common sense. Your Reverence, the most illustrious Signor
Don Rodrigo, our master, sends you his most respectful
salutations.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>This name was like a flash of light in the darkness and
confusion of Don Abbondio’s mind, but only served to
increase his terror. He instinctively made a low bow, and
said, “If you could suggest to me....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Suggest to you who know Latin!” interrupted
the bravo, with a laugh which was half ferocious and half
foolish. “That is your business. And, above all, never let
a word escape you about this hint which we have given you
for your good; otherwise&#160;... ahem!... it would be the
same thing as if you were to perform that marriage. Come!
What message do you wish us to give to the illustrious Don
Rodrigo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My respects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Explain yourself, your Reverence!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“... Disposed&#160;... always disposed to obedience....”
In uttering these words he did not quite know, himself,
whether he was giving a promise, or merely bestowing a
commonplace compliment. The bravoes took it—or
appeared to do so—in the more serious sense.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good. Good-night, your Reverence,” said one of
them, and turned, with his comrade, to depart. Don
Abbondio, who a few minutes before would have given one
of the eyes out of his head to get rid of them, now would
have liked to prolong the conversation. “Gentlemen,” he
began, shutting his book with both hands; but, without
listening to him, they took the road by which he had come,
singing the while a ditty better not transcribed, and were
soon out of sight. Poor Don Abbondio remained for a
moment with his mouth wide open, as if spell-bound;
then he turned up the lane leading to his house, walking
slowly, and seeming scarcely able to drag one leg after the
other....</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE INTERRUPTED WEDDING.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>[Don Abbondio, by finding one excuse after another for deferring the
marriage, has driven Renzo nearly to despair. At last, having discovered
the reason for the priest’s hesitation, in Don Rodrigo’s hostility,
he eagerly adopts a suggestion of Lucia’s mother, Agnese, to the effect
that a perfectly legal, though irregular, marriage may be performed
by the parties severally pronouncing, before a priest, and in the
presence of witnesses, the words, “This is my wife,” and “This is
my husband.” Renzo easily secures two witnesses, in the persons of
his friend Tonio and the latter’s half-witted brother. Tonio owes Don
Abbondio twenty-five <i><span lang="it">lire</span></i>, for which the priest holds his wife’s necklace
in pledge, and Renzo secures his co-operation by giving him the amount
of the debt. The five start at dusk for Don Abbondio’s house. Agnese
engages the priest’s housekeeper in conversation outside the front door,
and the others slip upstairs unnoticed—the bride and bridegroom
waiting on the landing, while Tonio knocks at the door of Don
Abbondio’s sitting-room.]</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i><span lang="it">Deo gratias!</span></i>” said Tonio, in a loud voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tonio, eh? Come in,” replied a voice from within.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tonio opened the door just wide enough to admit himself
and his brother, one at a time, and then closed it after him,
while Renzo and Lucia remained silent and motionless in
the dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Abbondio was sitting in an old arm-chair, wrapped
in a dilapidated dressing-gown, with an ancient cap on his
head, which made a frame all round his face. By the faint
light of a small lamp the two thick white tufts of hair which
projected from under the cap, his bushy white eyebrows,
moustache, and pointed beard all seemed, on his brown
and wrinkled face, like bushes covered with snow on a rocky
hillside seen by moonlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! ah!” was his salutation, as he took off his spectacles
and put them into the book he was reading.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your Reverence will say we are late in coming,” said
Tonio, bowing, as did Gervaso, but more awkwardly.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
<img src='images/i_086.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly it
is late—late in
every way. Do
you know that I
am ill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I am
very sorry, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You surely
must have heard
that I am ill,
and don’t know
when I can see
any one....
But why have
you brought that—that
fellow
with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! just for
company, like,
sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good—now
let us see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are
twenty-five new
<i><span lang="it">berlinghe</span></i>, sir—those
with Saint
Ambrose on
horseback on
them,” said
Tonio, drawing
a folded paper
from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us see,”
returned Abbondio,
and taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the paper, he put on his spectacles, unfolded it, took out
the silver pieces, turned them over and over, counted them,
and found them correct.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, your Reverence, will you kindly give me my Tecla’s
necklace?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right,” replied Don Abbondio; and going to a
cupboard, he unlocked it, and having first looked round, as
if to keep away any spectators, opened one side, stood in
front of the open door, so that no one could see in, put in
his head to look for the pledge, and his arm to take it out,
and, having extracted it, locked the cupboard, unwrapped the
paper, said interrogatively, “All right?” wrapped it up again,
and handed it over to Tonio.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said the latter, “would you please let me have a
little black and white, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This, too!” exclaimed Don Abbondio; “they are up
to every trick! Eh! how suspicious the world has grown!
Can’t you trust me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How, your Reverence, not trust you? You do me
wrong! But as my name is down on your book, on the
debtor side,&#160;... and you have already had the trouble of
writing it once, so&#160;... in case anything were to happen,
you know...”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
<img src='images/i_088.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“All right, all right,” interrupted Don Abbondio, and,
grumbling to himself, he opened the table drawer, took out
pen, paper, and inkstand, and began to write, repeating the
words out loud as he set them down. Meanwhile, Tonio,
and, at a sign from him, Gervaso, placed themselves in front
of the table, so as to prevent the writer from seeing the door,
and, as if in mere idleness, began to move their feet about
noisily on the floor, in order to serve as a signal to those
outside, and, at the same time, to deaden the sound of their
footsteps. Don Abbondio, intent on his work, noticed
nothing. Renzo and Lucia hearing the signal, entered on
tiptoe, holding their breath, and stood close behind the two
brothers. Meanwhile, Don Abbondio, who had finished
writing, read over the document attentively, without raising
his eyes from the paper, folded it, and saying, “Will you be
satisfied now?” took off his spectacles with one hand, and
held out the sheet to Tonio with the other. Tonio, while
stretching out his hand to take it, stepped back on one side,
and Gervaso, at a sign from him, on the other, and between
the two appeared Renzo and Lucia. Don Abbondio saw
them, started, was dumfoundered, became furious, thought it
over, and came to a resolution, all in the time that Renzo
took in uttering these words: “Your Reverence, in the
presence of these witnesses, this is my wife!” His lips had
not yet ceased moving when Don Abbondio let fall the
receipt, which he was holding in his left hand, raised the
lamp, and seizing the table-cloth with his right hand, dragged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>it violently towards him, throwing book, papers, and inkstand
to the ground, and, springing between the chair and table,
approached Lucia. The poor girl, with her sweet voice all
trembling, had only just been able to say “This is&#160;...”
when Don Abbondio rudely flung the table-cloth over her
head, and immediately dropping the lamp which he held in
his other hand, used the latter to wrap it tightly round her
face, nearly suffocating her, while he roared at the top of his
voice, like a wounded bull, “Perpetua! Perpetua! treason!
help!” When the light was out the priest let go his hold
of the girl, went groping about for the door leading into an
inner room, and, having found it, entered and locked himself
in, still shouting, “Perpetua! treason! help! get out of this
house! get out of this house!” In the other room all was
confusion; Renzo, trying to catch the priest, and waving
his hands about as though he had been playing at blindman’s
buff, had reached the door, and kept knocking, crying
out, “Open! open! don’t make a noise!” Lucia called
Renzo in a feeble voice, and said supplicatingly, “Let us
go! do let us go!” Tonio was down on his hands and
knees, feeling about the floor to find his receipt, while
Gervaso jumped about and yelled like one possessed, trying
to get out by the door leading to the stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the midst of this confusion we cannot refrain from a
momentary reflection. Renzo, raising a noise by night in
another man’s house, which he had surreptitiously entered,
and keeping its owner besieged in an inner room, has every
appearance of being an oppressor,—yet, after all, when you
come to look at it, he was the oppressed. Don Abbondio,
surprised, put to flight, frightened out of his wits while
quietly attending to his own business, would seem to be the
victim; and yet in reality, it was he who did the wrong. So
goes the world, as it often happens; at least, so it used to
go in the seventeenth century.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_090.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Nowadays, things are not what
they were.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are no children,—no boys; instead,
we have a swarm of little politicians
as yet unchristened—a crowd of Machiavellis
seen through the wrong end of an
opera-glass, who, if they do go to school
every day, only do so for the sake of
teaching their masters something—the
latter being sorely in need of instruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is it that has exterminated our
boys from off the face of the earth?</p>

<p class='c009'>The reading of political papers!</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a warning to fathers and
mothers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fathers of families, of course, are perfectly
at liberty to buy a daily paper—or
two, or five, or ten. For newspapers, even if taken to
excess, are like tamarind jelly—if they do no good, they
cannot do much harm. They are quite safe, if you know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>how to read them—the right way of the stuff, like English
broadcloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the mischief is this: fathers of families, when they
have glanced over the paper, usually leave it on the table, or
the sofa, or the mantelpiece—in short, in one of many
places that are within sight and reach of small boys. This
is great imprudence; because we must remember that our
boys are victims to a gluttonous, eager, devouring passion
for the reading of political papers. Perhaps this is an outcome
of that inborn instinct which shows itself at a very
early age in the love for fables and fairy tales.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then begin the troubles in the family.</p>

<p class='c009'>A small boy comes with the newspaper in his hand and
asks, his mother—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do tell me, mamma, what is the difference between
‘Authentic News’ and ‘Various News’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Authentic,’” replies the mother at random, “is what
really happens, and ‘Various’ is what the journalists invent
to fill up the paper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! what story-tellers!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, you should be very careful always to tell the
truth; if you don’t, you will go to Purgatory for seventy
years, and in this world every one will take you for a
journalist!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Amid the infinitely varied ranks of youth there are many
who, through innate depravity, and a fatally precocious
hankering after political life, carry their reckless temerity so
far as to read all the Parliamentary reports, from the first
line to the last!</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us say it once for all. When a boy gives himself up
without restraint, and without shame, to the reading of the
Parliamentary debates, it is all up with him! Good-bye to
candour; good-bye to innocence, and the simple language
of the age of infancy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>One day Cecco receives a maternal reprimand, because,
with his customary negligence, he has omitted to wash his
hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I repudiate the malignant insinuation,” replies the
culprit, immediately hiding the two inconvenient “documents”
in the pockets of his knickerbockers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another day Gigino refuses to go to school unless his
mother will give him the money to buy a cardboard Punch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear,” says his mother; “go away to school, and I
will buy you the Punch when you come home.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_092.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“No,
no, no; I
want it now!
And if I don’t get
it, I will make it a
Cabinet question!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor mother, at this
speech, finds her understanding failing her, and remains
open-mouthed. Then enters Raffaello, the elder brother,
who says to the younger—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Instead of thinking about Punches, you would do
better to study your grammar. Remember how yesterday
the master, after having three times called you a
donkey, ‘passed on to the order of the day, pure and
simple.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gigino was about to reply with an impertinence, but,
unwilling to fail in respect towards his elder brother, he
contented himself with making faces at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mamma (who has meanwhile recovered): “Is that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>way you treat your brother? He is older than you, and
you ought to respect him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gigino (raising his voice): “I have all possible esteem
and respect for the honourable member who has just
preceded me”—(the Debates again!); “but, on the other
hand, as far as I am concerned, he will always be a liar and
a spy....”</p>

<p class='c008'>Beppino is made of quicksilver. While carrying out
one trick he is already thinking of a new one, so that
neither in school nor at home is there any peace to be
had for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last his father, unable to stand it any longer, called
him into the study for a parental lecture.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the first division of the lecture Beppino was
surreptitiously gnawing a dried plum. At the opening of
the second division he removed the stone, and shot it
at the nose of a plaster Dante on the writing-desk. At
the third head Beppino lost all patience, and began to yell—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Enough! enough! The closure!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Closure or no closure!” cried his infuriated parent;
“if you interrupt me again with your impudence—rascal,
street-boy, chatterbox——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Order! order!” cried Beppino, pulling at the bell-rope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll order you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But, just as his father was about to rise, Beppino snatched
the smoking-cap from his head, and, putting it on himself,
remarked, in a nasal voice—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gentlemen, the President has put on his hat, and the
discussion is adjourned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The violent ringing of the bell summons the mother,
two aunts, the housemaid, and the lady’s little dog. These
having heard the narrative of Beppino’s unparalleled
insolence, are seized with such indignation that they begin
to laugh like mad.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The little dog, being unable to laugh like the rest, barks,
and evidences his share in the family joys and sorrows
by beginning to gnaw his dear master’s embroidered
slippers.</p>

<p class='c009'>All professions can yield a man enough to live on,—except

<p class='c009'>When attending the performance of some modern operas,

aside all the canons of art, is called the <i><span lang="it">Conservatoire</span></i>; and
a hospital full of sick people is called a “house of health”

<p class='c009'>Among the many motives which induce me to stay away

operas.</p>

<p class='c009'>How many old phrases are required to make a new

<p class='c009'>I entered the shop of a pork-butcher at the moment when

boy was weeping bitterly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The old story!” exclaimed his parent; “I suppose you
did not learn your lessons, and the master called you an ass,
as you deserved!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes!” replied the child, sobbing, “he <em>did</em> call me an
ass,—and then——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,—and then—what else?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said, ‘Well, after all, it is no wonder—<em>like father,
like son</em>!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did he, indeed? the animal!” exclaimed the pork-butcher.
“And to think that perhaps he has not yet
eaten the whole of those two sausages I sent him at
Christmas!”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>We have been told over and over again that “the style
is the man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I would substitute for this “The instrument is the
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And whereas the proverb runs, “Tell me who your friends
are, and I will tell you who you are,” I would amend it
thus, “Tell me what you blow into or scrape upon, and I
will tell your fortune.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After this, I must request professional gentlemen, employed
in orchestras and otherwise, not to suspect any
malicious intent in my remarks, which are principally aimed
at amateurs—those who murder some instrument or other
out of pure conviction,—all who began to twang the guitar
when they were studying medicine, or to practise on the
cornet after a year’s experience of matrimony.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Clarionet.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>This instrument consists of a severe cold in the head,
contained in a tube of yellow wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>The clarionet was not invented by the Conservatoire, but
by Fate.</p>

<p class='c009'>A chiropodist may be produced by study and hard work;
but the clarionet player is born, not made.</p>

<p class='c009'>The citizen predestined to the clarionet has an intelligence
which is almost obtuse up to the age of eighteen—an epoch
of incubation, when he begins to feel in his nose the first
thrills of his fatal vocation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then his intellect—limited even then—ceases its development
altogether; but his nasal organ, in revenge, assumes
colossal dimensions.</p>

<p class='c009'>At twenty he buys his first clarionet for fourteen francs;
and three months later his landlord gives him notice. At
twenty-five he is admitted into the band of the National
Guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>He dies of a broken heart on finding that not one of his
three sons shows the slightest inclination for the instrument
with which he has blown all his wits.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Trombone.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>The man who plays on this instrument is always one who
seeks oblivion in its society—oblivion of domestic troubles,
or consolation for love betrayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man who has held a metal tube in his mouth for six
months finds himself proof against every disillusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the age of fifty he finds that, of all human passions
and feelings, nothing is left him but an insatiable
thirst.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later on, if he wants to obtain the position of porter in a
gentleman’s house, or aspires to the hand of a woman with a
delicate ear, he tries to lay aside his instrument, but the taste
for loud notes and strong liquors only leaves him with life.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Finally, after a harmonious career of seventy-eight years, he
is apt to die of grief because the public-house keeper will
not let him have a glass of wine on credit.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Accordeon.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>This is the first instrument of youth and innocent hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The individual in question begins playing it in the back
room of his father’s shop—the latter, as a rule, is a chemist
by profession—and continues it up to the age of fifteen. At
this period, if he does not die, he deserts the accordeon for
the</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Harmoniflute.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>This instrument, on account of the nature of its
monotonous sounds and its tremendous plaintiveness,
acts on the nerves of those who hear, and predisposes to
melancholy those who play it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The harmoniflautist is usually tender and lymphatic of
constitution, with blue eyes, and eats only white meats and
farinaceous food.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a man, he is called Oscar; those of the other sex are
named Adelaide.</p>

<p class='c009'>At home, he or she is in the habit of bringing out the
instrument at dessert, and dinner being over, and the spirits
of the family, therefore, more or less cheerfully disposed,
will entertain the company with the <cite><span lang="it">Miserere</span></cite> in <cite><span lang="it">Il Trovatore</span></cite>,
or some similar melody.</p>

<p class='c009'>The harmoniflautist weeps easily. After practising on
the instrument for fifteen years or so, he or she dissolves
altogether, and is converted into a brook.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Organ.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>This complicated and majestic instrument is of a clerical
character, and destined, by its great volume of sound, to
drown the flat singing of clergy and congregation in church.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>The organist is usually a person sent into the world
with the vocation of making a great noise without undue
expenditure of strength; one who wants to blow harder than
others without wearing out his own bellows.</p>

<p class='c009'>He becomes at forty the intimate friend of the parish
priest, and the most influential person connected with the
church. By dint of repeating the same refrains every day
at matins and vespers, he acquires a knowledge of Latin,
and gets all the anthems, hymns, and masses by heart. At
fifty he marries a devout spinster recommended by the
parish priest.</p>

<p class='c009'>He makes a kind and good-tempered husband; his only
defect in that capacity being his habit of dreaming out loud
on the eve of every ecclesiastical solemnity. On Easter Eve,
for instance, he nearly always awakens his wife by intoning,
with the full force of his lungs, “<i><span lang="la">Resurrexit</span></i>.” The good
woman, thus abruptly aroused, never fails to answer him
with the orthodox “<i><span lang="it">Alleluia!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the age of sixty he becomes deaf, and then begins to
think his own playing perfection. At seventy he usually dies
of a broken heart, because the new priest, who knows not
Joseph, instead of asking him to dine at the principal table
with the ecclesiastics and other church authorities, has
relegated him to an inferior place, and the society of the
sacristan and the grave-digger.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Flute.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>The unhappy man who succumbs to the fascinations of
this instrument is never one who has attained the full
development of his intellectual faculties. He always has
a pointed nose, marries a short-sighted woman, and dies run
over by an omnibus.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flute is the most fatal of all instruments. It requires
a peculiar conformation and special culture of the thumb-nail,

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The man who plays the flute frequently adds to his other
infirmities a mania for keeping tame weasels, turtle-doves, or
guinea-pigs.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Violoncello.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>To play the ’cello you require to have long, thin fingers;
but it is still more indispensable to have very long hair falling
over a greasy coat-collar.</p>

<p class='c009'>In case of fire, the ’cellist who sees his wife and his ’cello
in danger will save the latter first.</p>

<p class='c009'>His greatest satisfaction, as a general thing, is that of
“making the strings weep.” Sometimes, indeed, he succeeds
in making his wife and family do the same thing in consequence
of a regimen of excessive frugality. Sometimes, too,
it happens to him to make people laugh and yawn, but
this, according to him, is the result of atmospheric influences.</p>

<p class='c009'>He can express, through his loftily-attuned strings, all
possible griefs and sorrows, except those of his audience
and his creditors.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Drum.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>An immense apparatus of wood and sheepskin, full of
air and of sinister presages. In melodrama the roll of the
drum serves to announce the arrival of a fatal personage,
an agent of Destiny; in most cases, an ill-used husband.
Sometimes this funereal rumbling serves to describe silence—sometimes
to indicate the depths of the <i><span lang="it">prima donna’s</span></i>
despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The drummer is a serious man, possessed with the sense
of his high dramatic mission. He is able, however, to
conceal his conscious pride, and sleep on his instrument
when the rest of the orchestra is making all the noise it can.
In such cases he commissions the nearest of his colleagues
to awaken him at the proper moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>On awaking, he seizes the two drum-sticks and begins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>to beat; but, should his neighbour forget to rouse him, he
prolongs his slumbers till the fall of the curtain. Then he
shakes himself, perceives that the opera is over, and rubs his
eyes; and if it happens that the conductor reprimands him
for his remissness at the <em>attack</em>, he shrugs his shoulders and
replies, “Never mind, the tenor died all the same. A roll
of the drum more or less, what does it signify?”</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Big Drum.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>Of this it is quite unnecessary to speak. It is the instrument
of the age; and ministers, deputies, men of science,
poets, hairdressers, and dentists have all learned to
perform on it to perfection.... The multitude will always
answer the summons of its “<em>boom! boom!</em>”—and he will
always be in the right who thumps it hardest.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>“My dear boy,” said Giuntini, almost seriously, “I lost
all my illusions at eighteen. At that epoch I believed
that I possessed a sweetheart; I was also guilty of the
audacity of writing verses to her. I lived on blue sky,
diluted with milk and honey. Afterwards I found out that
my verses were based on a false supposition, and that the
girl I loved had married a custom house officer. This contributed
in great part to the catastrophe which took place in
my sentiments. At the present moment I have been writing
in the papers for seventeen years. I get 250 francs a month
here, on the <cite>Progressist</cite>; eighty francs from a paper at Udine,
whose politics I do not even know; another sixty from the
<cite>Courier of Fashion</cite>; and beside that, I send leading articles,
at five francs apiece, to the Radical <cite>Phrygian Cap</cite>, of
Rimini, and others to the <cite>Catholic Banner</cite>, of Genoa, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>pays me eight francs for each. Add to this a sermon written
now and then for the parish priest of our village at home—a
conceited old fanatic who wants to be thought eloquent.
Then I have to compile the <cite>Young Wife’s Almanac</cite> every
year, and the <cite>Sportsman’s and Angler’s Calendar</cite> for the publisher,
Corretti; so that, taking one month with another, I
can reckon on about 500 francs. I say nothing of contriving
to advertise various tradesmen and contractors, in the course
of my daily paragraphs, which brings me in nice little sums
now and then. Very well; every month I manage not to
spend more than 200 francs, the rest I put aside. I don’t
go to the theatre; I am not to be seen at <i><span lang="fr">cafés</span></i>; as for lending
money to my friends, you have perceived——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have, alas!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There you have the explanation of my easy life. My
dear fellow, the world is for him who knows how to take it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may be,” said Lauri; “the fault is mine. I don’t
deny it. Sometimes, do you know, I think of the little
village at the foot of the Alps, all white with snow in winter....
What a fuss they used to make over me when I came
home for the holidays!... How my father used to rest
his great rough hand on my head, and say, “There’s plenty
inside here!”&#160;... Well, and then came Sixty-six.
Venice! Venice for ever! Garibaldi! Italy! Liberty!...
In those days, as you know, we believed in all that—and
I went to the Tyrol after Garibaldi. There was no
holding me after that. I thought I had the whole world at
my feet. I never even thought of the University Entrance
Examination. To think of it! A warrior who has smelt
powder to go back to a schoolboy’s tasks!... I could not
even dream of such a thing—and of returning to the village
even less. I should have had to talk politics with the chemist
and the police-sergeant, when I had in my own person contributed
to the unity of Italy. I do not know myself what
grand dreams were shaping themselves in this stupid brain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of mine. I went to Florence, and passed some months in
wearing out the pavement of Via Tornabuoni and Via Calzaioli,
and my father, poor dear old man! used to send me
postal orders.... But I was going to make a career at
Florence! I was always in company with some of my old
comrades of the Tyrol, all of them fervent patriots, who
passed most of their time in speaking ill of their neighbours
on the sofas of the <cite><span lang="it">Bottegone</span></cite>. I began to make the acquaintance
of deputies and journalists, lounged about the editorial
offices of the <cite><span lang="it">Diritto</span></cite> and the <cite><span lang="it">Riforma</span></cite>, and talked glibly
about the crisis, Reconstruction, and the fusion of parties.
In short, I was well on the way to imbecility; and from
thence to journalism is, as you know, but a step. And now,
as I’ve made my bed, I’ve got to lie upon it, or throw myself
out of the window.... There’s no father to send me
postal orders now....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Giuntini suddenly interrupted the flow of his reflections.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, Manfredo, do you know it’s ten o’clock, and you
have not written a line of the daily ‘summary’ yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lauri shook himself, re-lit his cigar, which had gone out,
and once more began turning over the papers. Giuntini,
too, had gone back to work; but he, like all journalists,
could cut all Europe to pieces, though his thoughts were
wandering in the sphere of the moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What telegrams has the <cite>Times</cite> to-day?” he asked while
scribbling away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“None; neither the <cite>Times</cite>, nor the <cite>Daily News</cite>, nor the
<cite>Temps</cite>, nor the <cite>Nord</cite>; they are all empty as my pockets. I
don’t in the least know how to make up this evening’s
Foreign Intelligence. There is a little about Afghanistan in
the <cite>République</cite>, but all stale matter hashed up for the third
or fourth time. I shall have to end by translating the latest
Assembly scandal from the <cite>Figaro</cite>.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>It is said among business men that it requires twelve Jews
to cheat a Genoese; but twelve Genoese are not
enough to cheat a Greek.... Only one person, that I ever
heard of, enjoys the not very enviable distinction of having
cheated—not merely one Greek, but two.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a Bari man.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was returning to Italy, but had no boots—or rather,
the things he had were no longer boots. He carefully
counted up his money, found that he had not enough to
buy a new pair, and so quieted his conscience. Then he
went to a shoemaker’s in the Street of Hermes.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“I want a pair of shoes by Monday morning, to fit me
exactly, with round toes,” etc.; in short, he gave the fullest
directions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, sir. You shall have them without fail. They
shall be sent to your house at ten on Monday morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Bari man left his address and departed.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Street of Æolus he entered another shoemaker’s
shop and ordered a precisely similar pair of shoes in the
same terms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have I made myself understood?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfectly. Let me have the address, and on Monday
at ten——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not be in at ten. Don’t send them before
eleven.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At eleven you may count on having them, without fail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On Monday at ten the first victim appeared. The
gentleman tried on the shoes; the right was a perfect fit,
the left was fearfully tight over the instep; it wanted
stretching a little.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” said the obliging tradesman; “I will take it
away, and bring it back to you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Very well; and I will settle your account then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The shoemaker bowed himself out with the left shoe.</p>

<p class='c009'>At eleven, punctual as a creditor, arrived the second predestined
victim. The same scene was repeated; but this
time it was the right shoe that did not fit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will have to put it over the last again, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll soon set that right, sir.” And this shoemaker,
more knowing than the other, was about to take both shoes
away with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave the other,” said the Bari man. “It’s a fancy of
mine&#160;... if you take them both, some one may come in
and find that they fit him, and you will sell them to him,
and I shall have to wait another week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I assure you, sir——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, my friend; I know how things go. I want this
pair of shoes and no other, and I insist on keeping the one.”
The shoemaker bowed his head with a sigh, and went
away to stretch the right shoe.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later the Bari man and his shoes were already on
board the Piræus steamer; and on the following day the
two victims met on his doorstep, each with a shoe in his
hand, and looked into each other’s rapidly lengthening
faces.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>About a week after my arrival at Athens I was enjoying
a <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>, at the Samos Restaurant, with a lamb
cutlet of most unexampled obduracy, when there entered a
stout individual, somewhere on the wrong side of fifty,
dressed with great care, and sporting a gold chain of such
length and massiveness that it might have served to fasten
up a mastiff. His hands were covered with rings; and, in
entering, he made noise enough for ten. Accosting a waiter
who could speak Italian, he roared—</p>

<p class='c009'>“This way,—this way, sir; there are four places at this
table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the one where I was sitting.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stout gentleman contorted his features with disgust,
uttered language which would have been enough for any
Arian, and came and sat beside me, remarking—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it">Giuraddio!</span></i> I don’t want my place taken!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Every one present was looking at him, and smiling
compassionately.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before he had finished unfolding his napkin he was
already asking me—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you Italian, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Been in Athens long?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A few days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been here three months. Every one knows
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think so, if you always make as much noise as
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see how they are looking at me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have noticed it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I&#160;... I suppose you know who I am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not that honour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am the celebrated Spalletti.... You will know——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I confess my ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it">Giuraddio!</span></i> half the newspapers in the world have

<p class='c009'>“I read very few newspapers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I am a journalist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am here. I have already given six representations of

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“And you are——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The celebrated tenor, Spalletti.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blessed be modesty!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh!—What?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing—only a remark on my part. A fine opera, <cite><span lang="it">Le

<p class='c009'>“Yes—so they say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How—they say? Have you never heard it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I!—I have other things to do. I get through my scenes,
and that’s enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But have you not even read the words?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have read my part,—and even that is too much.
However, I think I will read it over one evening when I am
going to bed, because I want to know who on earth this
<em>Prophet</em> is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet it was this very part of the Prophet which he had just
enacted for the sixth time!</p>

<p class='c009'>He then told me that he had been engaged to sing in
Thomas’s <cite><span lang="it">Omeleto</span></cite>—I should not have been surprised
had he said <i><span lang="it">omelette</span></i>—and left, after telling me that he put
up at the Gran Bretagna, and requesting me to come and see
him there.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the door he turned back, and said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must come and hear me at the theatre to-night!
I am quite convinced I shall make you shed tears.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I went—and found that the worthy man was right. His
performance was such that it would have drawn tears from a
stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>I afterwards heard that the same gentleman had been
asked to sing at a charity concert, and, being told that in
this way he would perform an <em>act of philanthropy</em>, had
replied that it was unfortunately impossible, because he was

could not sing in any act of it.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>RIVAL EARTHQUAKES.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>There was a long-standing rivalry—and one that was
not professional alone—between the telegraph clerks
of Pietranera and Golastretta. It is said to have begun at
the Technical College, when the former carried off a silver
medal hotly contested by the other; but this is not quite
certain.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is certain is that Pippo Corradi could not undertake
the smallest thing but Nino d’Arco immediately proceeded
to do likewise. Thus when the former took a fancy to
become an amateur conjurer, Nino at once went in search
of the necessary apparatus for amusing his friends with the
miracles of white magic. He was not a success; he raised
many a laugh by his want of skill; but this did not prevent
him from throwing away more money still on boxes with
false bottoms, pistols to shoot playing cards instead of
balls, wonderful balls which multiply and grow larger in
your hands, and the like. Cost what it might, he was
determined to astonish his Golastretta friends, who extolled
in his presence the portents they had seen accomplished at
Pietranera by Corradi, and derided him by way of contrast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then when Pippo Corradi, who was of a strange
fickleness in his tastes, gave up white magic in order to
devote himself to music, and the study of the clarionet in
particular, Nino d’Arco suddenly laid aside the magic toys,
which had already wearied him not a little, took music
lessons from the parish organist, bought a brand new ebony
clarionet, and rode over on a donkey to call on Corradi,
under the pretext of consulting him on his choice, but
with the sole intention of humiliating him. It was the only
time he ever succeeded. He found him blowing into the
mouthpiece of a box-wood instrument, which he had bought
second-hand for a few francs from an old clarionet player
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>in the town band. Nino swelled visibly with satisfaction
at seeing the admiration and envy in his rival’s eyes when
he opened the leather case and showed him the polished
keys of white metal, shining even more than the freshly
varnished wood.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_108.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nino put the instrument together delicately, and set it to
his mouth, thinking to astonish Pippo with a scale in
semitones, but he unluckily broke down in the middle.
Then was Corradi able to take his revenge; and not content
with having played scales in all tones, major, minor, diatonic,
and chromatic, suddenly, without warning Nino, who kept
staring at his fingers manœuvring over the holes and keys,
he dashed point-blank into his <i><span lang="fr">pièce-de-résistance</span></i>, <cite><span lang="it">La Donna
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>è Mobile</span></cite>, tootling away quite divinely, till checked by the
imperative need of taking breath. His eyes were nearly
starting out of his head; his face was purple—but that was
nothing! He chuckled inwardly at Nino’s crestfallen look;
and the latter, taking his instrument to pieces, put it back
in the case, thus declaring himself vanquished.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_109.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nino, returning to Golastretta, vented his vexation on his
ass, because she would not go at a trot—just as though it
had been she who taught Corradi to play <cite><span lang="it">La Donna è Mobile</span></cite>.
So true it is that passion renders man unjust! He rushed at
once to his master to learn <cite><span lang="it">La Donna è Mobile</span></cite> for himself, so
as to be able, in a short time, to play it before his hated rival.
The latter, however, had another great advantage, besides
that of being able to murder <em>Rigoletto</em>; he was the local
post-master. In this point it was useless trying to rival him,
however much Nino might dream of a spacious office, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>that at Pietranera, where Corradi, between the sale of one
stamp and the next, between registering a letter, and
administering a reprimand to the postman, could divert
himself by blowing into his clarionet to his heart’s content!
Whereas he, Nino, was forced to escape from the house if
he wished to practise and remain at peace with his family!
Corradi, in his post-office, disturbed no one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nino did not know what a torment for the neighbourhood
that clarionet was, shrilling from morning to night, with
Corradi’s usual obstinacy in anything he undertook. The
shopkeeper opposite, poor wretch, swore all day long worse
than a Turk, and did not know whether he was standing on
his head or his feet every time that Pippo began to repeat
the <cite><span lang="it">Donna è Mobile</span></cite>—that is to say, swore seven or eight
times in the day. He made mistakes in his weights, he
counted his change wrong;—though it is only fair to say that
these errors were oftener in his own favour than in that of
his customers. And if by any chance he saw Corradi at the
window, he raised his hands towards him with a supplicating
gesture, pretending to be jocular.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You want to make me die of a fit! Good Lord!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of all this Nino d’Arco was quite ignorant when he
started for Pietranera a month later, to surprise Corradi with
<i><span lang="it">Mira Norma</span></i>, which he had learnt, in addition to the air
which first roused his emulation. He found Pippo adding
up his monthly accounts, and not disposed to talk about
music or anything else. The fact was that the shopkeeper
opposite had indeed fallen down dead in a fit at the third
or fourth rendering of <cite><span lang="it">La Donna è Mobile</span></cite>, as he had said,
just as though he had had a presentiment of what was to
happen. The occurrence had such an effect on Pippo that
he felt as if he had killed the man, and could not bear to
touch the clarionet again. He would not even mention the
subject. Nino bit his lips and returned home, without
having so much as opened his clarionet case. Once more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>it was the ass who paid the penalty. He had to relieve his
feelings on some one or something.</p>

<p class='c009'>If there were any need of an instance to prove that emulation
is the most powerful agent in the development of the
human faculties, this one would suffice. Seeing that Corradi
had renounced the clarionet and all its delights, Nino
no longer felt the slightest inclination to go on wasting his
breath on his instrument, though it were of ebony, with keys
of white metal. As a faithful historian, I ought to add that
for one moment he was tempted by the idea of trying to
attain to the glory of causing some one’s death by a fit;
but whether the Golastretta people had harder tympanums
than those of Pietranera, or whether he himself was not
possessed of the necessary strength and perseverance, certain
it is that no human victim fell to Nino d’Arco’s clarionet.
And the fact of having no death on his conscience made
him feel degraded in his own eyes for some time.</p>

<p class='c008'>These had been the preludes to deeper and more difficult
contests with his old schoolfellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Golastretta was situated between the central office of the
province and the rival station of Pietranera; and thus it was
Nino’s duty to signal to his hated colleague the mean time
by which he was to regulate his clock—a supremacy which
Corradi could never take from him. But this was a joy of
short duration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having very little to do, he was wont, after he had finished
reading the <cite>Gazette</cite> or the last paper-covered novel, to snatch
forty winks at his ease in the office. One morning, when he
least expected it, the machine began clicking, and would not
stop. It was his dear friend at Pietranera who kept sending
despatches on despatches, and would not let him drop off
comfortably.</p>

<p class='c009'>By listening attentively, he soon made out what was the
matter. The village of Pietranera had begun, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>previous evening, to dance like a man bitten by the
tarantula, set in motion by earthquake-shocks repeated
from hour to hour. The Syndic was telegraphing to the
Vice-Prefect, the Prefect, the Meteorological Office of the
province, in the name of the terrified population. And
Corradi, too, was telegraphing on his own account, signalling
the shocks as fast as they occurred, and indicating their
length, or the nature of the movement—in order to gain
credit with his superiors, said Nino d’Arco, vexed that Golastretta
should not have its half-dozen earthquakes as well.</p>

<p class='c009'>How cruelly partial was Nature! Scarcely twenty kilomètres
away she was rendering Corradi an immense
service with eight, ten, twenty shocks—between day
and night—within the week; and for him not even the
smallest vestige of any shock whatever. He could get
no peace, and kept his ear to the instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day, behold! there passed the announcement of
a scientific commission on its way to Pietranera in order
to study these persistent seismic phenomena. A few days
later he became aware of the transit of another despatch
appointing the Pietranera telegraph-agent director of the
Meteorologico-Seismic station, which the commission had
thought it advisable to establish at that place. In a month
from that time the speedy arrival of a large number of
scientific instruments was wired down from headquarters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nino d’Arco could stand it no longer; nothing would
serve but he must go and see with his own eyes what
under the canopy that Meteorologico-Seismic Observatory
could be which would not let him live in peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could not recover from the astonishment into which
he was thrown by the sight of all these machines already
set up in position, whose strange names Pippo Corradi
reeled off with the greatest ease, as he explained the
working of each. Rain-gauge, wind-gauge, barometers,
maximum and minimum thermometers, hygrometers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>besides that a tromometer, and all sorts of devilries for
marking the very slightest shocks of earthquake, indicating
their nature, and recording the very hour at which they
occurred, by means of stop-watches.... Nino was very
far from understanding it all, but made believe to do so;
and, at last, he remained quite a time gazing through a
magnifying-glass at the pendulum constructed to register
the movements of the earthquake by marking them with a
sharp point on a sheet of smoked glass placed beneath it....
The pendulum was at that moment moving, sometimes
from right to left, sometimes backwards and forwards,
but with so imperceptible a movement that it could not be
discerned by the naked eye.... Suddenly—<i><span lang="it">drin! drin!</span></i>—there
is a ringing of bells, the pendulum quivers....</p>

<p class='c009'>“A shock!” And Pippo, triumphant, rushes to the
telegraph instrument to announce it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not feel anything!” said Nino d’Arco, white
with terror.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he hastened to go. But he was simply knocked
to pieces by all those machines and the satisfied air of his
colleague. The latter already signed himself “Director of
the Meteorologico-Seismic Observatory at Pietranera,” and
seemed a great personage—reflected Nino—even to him,
who knew very well who he was, a telegraph clerk just
like himself!</p>

<p class='c009'>All along the homeward road, when he had finished
settling accounts with the ass, he ruminated over the
hundreds of francs which all that apparatus must have
cost.... The seismographic pendulum, however, was
only worth eighteen.... He would like to have at
least a pendulum.... What would he do with it
when he had it? No one could tell; least of all
himself. But the pendulum kept vibrating in his brain
all the week, backwards and forwards, right and left,
scratching the smoked glass at every stroke. Nino seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>to himself to be always standing behind the magnifying-glass,
as he had done at Pietranera. It was a diabolical
persecution!</p>

<p class='c008'>He had to humble himself before his detested colleague,
in order to get information, explanations and instruments;
but after all, in the end, the pendulum was there in its
place, near the office window. It had cost him nearly half
his month’s salary. But what of that? Now, he too could
telegraph the most beautiful earthquakes, on occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>But just look at the perversity of things! That infamous
pendulum—as if on purpose to spite him—remained perfectly
motionless, even if one looked at it through the
magnifying-glass. Nino, who passed whole days ruining his
eyes with that glass, anxious to observe the first trace of
movement, so as to signal it, and thus begin his competition
with the Pietranera observatory, ground his teeth with rage.
Especially on the days when his fortunate rival seemed
to be mocking him with the ticking of the messages which
announced to the Provincial Office some little shock recorded
by the instruments at Pietranera. For an earthquake—a
real earthquake—Nino would have given, who can tell what?
perhaps his very soul. In the meantime he dreamt of earthquakes,
often awaking terrified in the night, uncertain
whether it were a dream, or the shock had really taken
place; but the pendulum remained stern and immovable.
It was enough to drive the veriest saint desperate. Ah!
Was that the game? Did the earthquakes obstinately refuse
to manifest themselves? Well, he would invent them. After
all, who could contradict him? And so that unlucky parish,
which had been for centuries quietly anchored to the rocky
mountain-side, began to perform in its turn—in the Reports
of the Meteorological Office at Rome—an intricate dance of
shocks, slight shocks, and approaches to shocks; there was
no means of keeping it still any longer. And as Nino could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>not forego the glory of showing his friends the sheet where
his name appeared in print beside those of several famous
men of science, the report spread through the country that
the mountain was moving, imperceptibly, and threatened to
come down in a landslip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it really true?” the most timid came to ask.</p>

<p class='c009'>“True, indeed!” replied Nino solemnly, and pointed to
the pendulum; but he would allow no one to examine it at
close quarters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as though it had been done on purpose, the Pietranera
observatory no longer signalled any disturbances since
Golastretta had begun to amuse itself by frequent
vibrations; and Pippo Corradi, suspecting the trick of his
colleague, was gnawing his own heart out over all the false
indications which were quietly being foisted in among the
genuine ones of the official report, and making a mock of
Science.</p>

<p class='c009'>He, for his own part, did his work seriously and
scrupulously, even leaving his dinner when the hour for
observation came; and his reports might be called models
of scientific accuracy. Ought he to denounce his colleague?
to unmask him? He could not make up his mind. The
latter, as bold as brass, went on making his village quake
and tremble, as though it were nothing at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>This time the proverb that “lies have short legs” did not
hold good; for the lies in question reached Tacchini at
Rome, and Father Denza at Moncalieri. Perhaps, even,
they confused the calculations of those unfortunate scientists,
who were very far from suspecting, in the remotest degree,
the wickedness of Nino.</p>

<p class='c009'>But one day, all of a sudden, the Golastretta pendulum
awoke from its torpor, and began to move behind the
magnifying-glass, although to the naked eye its motion was
scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nino gave a howl of joy. “At last! at last!”</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
<img src='images/i_116.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To the first person who
happened to come into
the office he said, with
a majestic sweep of the
arm, “Look here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall have a big
earthquake!” and he
rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man, who had felt
his head turning round
with the continued agitation
of the pendulum, and
was struck with consternation
to find that it could
scarcely be perceived
without the magnifier,
rushed at once to spread
the terrible news in streets,
shops, and <i><span lang="fr">cafés</span></i>. In an
hour the telegraph office
was invaded—besieged.
Everybody wished to see
with his or her own eyes,
so as to be certain, and
then take a resolution.
And the people who had
seen frightened the others
with their accounts, exaggerating
matters, giving
explanations more terrifying
than those they had
received and half understood,
and so increasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the panic, which now began to seize on the most sceptical
spirits. An extraordinary success for Nino d’Arco! He
seemed to see before him the image of his colleague,
jaundiced with envy, and again rubbed his hands with
delight. Outside, the street was full of people discussing
the affair with comments. Women were crying, boys
shouting, “Is it still moving?” “Worse than before.”
“Oh! blessed Madonna!” The parish priest hastened to
the spot, frightened as badly as the rest by the news which
had been carried to him by the sacristan; and scarcely had
he looked through the glass than he sprang from his chair
as if he had felt the ground rocking under his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the judgment of God, gentlemen! On account of
our sins, gentlemen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the people began to get away as fast as they could.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a banging of shutters, a hurried closing of doors,
a rushing about, a shouting of each other’s names. “Is it
still moving?” “Worse than ever!” So that at last Nino
d’Arco himself no longer felt easy. And from time to time
he turned back to look once more at the pendulum, which
continued to vibrate. It was the first time that Nino found
himself indeed, as it were, face to face with a distant
indication of earthquake, after the hundred or so of shocks,
of all sorts, strengths, and sizes, which he had invented and
caused to be published in the Report at Rome. And now
it was not exactly an amusing thing—that dumb menace,
to which his ignorance gave a false significance. Pendulum
of the devil! Would it never be still? A beautiful invention
of science, calculated to kill a peaceful citizen with anticipatory
fear! Who ever heard of the earth being shaken
without people becoming aware of it?</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed to him that the vibrations increased from hour
to hour, and that the danger of a general fall of buildings
became more imminent every minute. He was alone in
the office,—there was not a soul to be seen in the street,—every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>one had left the village, to seek safety in the open
plain. And his duty, as telegraph operator, forbade him to
move!</p>

<p class='c009'>Towards evening he closed the office, and went out into
the plain himself. The people were standing about in groups,
telling their beads and chanting litanies. When they saw him
they were near falling upon him, as the cause of the mischief.
Was it not he who had turned the whole village upside
down, with that accursed pendulum of his? The whole
scene had a depressing effect on him, however much he
might try to keep up his courage,
and convince his fellow-townsmen
of the great benefits of his warning,
which might, for all they knew, have
been the saving of many lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at noon on the following
day nothing had yet happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every quarter of an hour some
one of the bravest came in from the
country to the telegraph
office, to find
out how things
were going. The
pendulum still vibrated—but
there
were no news of
the predicted
earthquake.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_118.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The evening
came. Not the
ghost of an earthquake!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>A few, here and there, began to turn the thing
into ridicule. The syndic—who had a head on his
shoulders—had sent a boy to the Pietranera. When the
boy returned with Pippo Corradi’s answer, “It’s all nonsense—make
your minds easy!” there was an explosion
of “Oh!—oh!—oh!” and those who had been most
frightened, and felt that they had been made fools of, began
to yell, “Imbecile! Blockhead! Idiot!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They rushed in a tumultuous noisy crowd to the telegraph
office; and had they not met with the lieutenant of the
Carbineers, who had hastened up on receipt of a cipher
telegram from the chief constable, who knows how the
matter might have ended for Nino d’Arco?</p>

<p class='c009'>“What on earth have you been doing?” said the
lieutenant. “You have been disturbing the public
peace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nino was petrified for a moment; then, seeking to excuse
himself by proof positive, pointed to the pendulum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” said the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look—it moves!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must be seeing double. There is nothing moving
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do look carefully.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Allow me.... Nothing moving!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In fact, the pendulum had stopped. Nino would not
believe his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I confiscate it, for the present!” cried the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, raising the glass of the case, he took out the tube in
which the pendulum was fixed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When one is as ignorant as you, sir,&#160;...” Every one
present applauded vigorously. “And I shall report the
matter to headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To Nino it mattered nothing that the crowd should
applaud and hiss, or that the lieutenant of the Carbineers
should report him at headquarters. He was thinking only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of Pippo Corradi, and how he would laugh behind his back
when he heard it; and the tears stood in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, as though all this had not been enough, behold, on
the following day, the following message clicked along the
wires from Corradi:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-day, 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, upward shock of first degree, lasting
three seconds; followed, after interval of seven seconds, by
undulatory shock, south-north, also first degree, lasting five
seconds. No damage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Infamous fate!” stammered Nino d’Arco. And he
shut off the current, to escape from the clicks which
seemed to deride him.</p>

<img src='images/i_121.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Poor Don Mario!
No sooner was
he seen coming round
the corner with his
rusty, narrow-brimmed,
stove-pipe hat, nearly a
foot high, and his overcoat
with long tails
fluttering in the wind,
than every one—first
the boys, then the men,
the loafers on Piazza
Buglio, and even the
gentlemen at the Casino—began
to salute him,
on every side, with
the cry of the quail,
“<em>Quacquarà! Quacquarà!</em>”
just because
they knew
that it enraged
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped and
stood at bay, staring round, brandishing his great cudgel,
and shaking his head threateningly. Then he would take
two or three steps forward, looking fixedly at them, in order
to discover one or other of the impudent wretches who
so far forgot the respect due to him, the son and grandson
of lawyers—to him who stood a hundred times higher
than all those gentlemen of the Casino.... But in vain!
On the right hand and the left, before and behind, rose
the shouts and whistles, “<em>Quacquarà! Quacquarà!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Don’t excite yourself! Let them shout!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I do not kill some one, they will never be quiet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you want to go to the convict prison for nothing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will send them there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He became red as a turkey-cock, raving and gesticulating
and foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They would be quiet enough, if you did not get angry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are cowards! Why don’t they come out like
men, and say it to my face?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Quacquarà!</em>”——</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! would you hit a child?” This time, if they had
not stopped him, he would have broken the head of the
barber’s boy, who had boldly approached him near enough
to utter the objectionable cry under his very nose. There
was trouble enough before Don Mario would let himself be
dragged away into the chemist’s shop, which was filled with
a laughing crowd. Vito, the chemist’s young man, came
forward, very seriously, and said to him—</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does it matter if they <em>do</em> say <em>Quacquarà</em> to you?
You don’t happen to be a quail, do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Mario turned furious eyes on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well; it’s not as if they called you a thief!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a gentleman, and the son of a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well? What does <em>Quacquarà</em> mean? Nothing at all.
<em>Quacquarà</em> let it be!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chemist and the others present were writhing in convulsions
of suppressed laughter at the serious countenance
of Vito, who, under the pretext of lecturing Don Mario for
his folly, kept on repeating the quail’s cry to his very face,
without his perceiving that it was done on purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I,” said he, “if a man were to cry <em>Quacquarà</em> after
me, I would give him a halfpenny every time. <em>Quacquarà!
Quacquarà!</em> Shout yourselves hoarse, if you like!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, meanwhile, you scoundrel, you’re repeating it to
my face,” yelled Don Mario, as he raised his cudgel, perceiving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>at last that he had been made a fool of. At this point
the chemist, who was terrified for the safety of his plate-glass
windows, thought it time to interfere; and, taking his arm,
drew him out of the shop, condoling with his grievances,
and soothing his ruffled feelings as well as he could.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come out this way; no one will see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I to hide myself? To please those louts? I am a
gentleman, and the son of a gentleman!”</p>

<p class='c008'>True—very true! The Majori had always been respectable
people, son succeeding father in the notary’s office
from generation to generation, up to the year 1819; in
which year there issued forth from the infernal regions that
judgment of Heaven called the Code Napoléon, specially
created for the despair of the notary Majori, Don Mario’s
father, who never could understand it, and was forced to
retire from his profession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What? No more Latin formulas?... And documents
to be headed ‘In the King’s Name’! But what has
his Majesty the King to do with private contracts?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he relieved his conscience by having no more to do
with the whole business. And so the ink had dried up in
the great brass inkstand in his office, and the quill pens
were all worn out; and the quiet in the house contrasted
strangely with the bustle there had been formerly, when
every one came to consult him, for he was honesty in
person, and never set down on the papers a single word
more or less than the interested parties wished. And thus,
Don Mario, who had hitherto acted as clerk in his father’s
office, and knew by heart all the Latin formulas, without
understanding a syllable thereof, found his occupation
gone. So did his brother Don Ignazio, who was not
much more capable than himself; and after the old
notary had died of a broken heart, on account of that
unholy Code which had no Latin formulas, and insisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>on having documents headed <em>In the King’s Name</em>, the
two brothers eked out a sordid livelihood on the little
they inherited from him. But they were proud in their
honourable poverty, and rigidly faithful to the past, even
in their dress, continuing for a time to wear their old
clothes, carefully brushed and mended, regardless of the
fact that they were out of fashion and excited ridicule.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Ignazio, however, could not stand it long. When
his beaver hat seemed to him quite useless, and his overcoat
too threadbare, he bought a second-hand hat for a few pence
from Don Saverio, the old-clothes dealer, and a coat which
had also been worn already, but presented a better appearance
than his old one. Don Mario, on the other hand,
stood firm, and went about in his rusty tall hat and long
coat of half a century ago, shabby and darned, but without
a spot. He was not going to derogate from his past—he,
the son and grandson of notaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came hard times,—bad harvests,—the epidemic of
1837,—the cholera,—the revolution of ’48;—and the two
brothers passed disagreeable days and still more unpleasant
nights, racking their brains for the means of procuring a
glass of wine for the morrow, or a little oil for the salad or
the soup.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow I will go to So-and-so,” Don Mario would
say. “Meanwhile we must sweep out the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They did everything themselves; and while Don Ignazio
cut up an onion to put into the evening’s salad, Don Mario,
in his father’s indoor coat, all faded and mended, began
carefully to sweep the rooms like a housemaid. He dusted
the rickety tables and the old ragged, leather-covered arm-chairs;
and then, having gathered up all the dirt into a
basket, he would cautiously open the door, to make sure
there was no one within sight, and, late at night, carried it
out and deposited it behind the wall of a ruined house
which had become the dust-bin of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>And on the way he would pick up stones, cabbage-stumps,
bits of orange or pumpkin-peel, so as to clean up the street
also, seeing that no one troubled about it, every one being
too much occupied with his or her own business to pay
any attention to cleanliness. Cleanliness was his fixed
idea—indoors and out. It often happened that Don
Ignazio, finding that he was late in coming home, was
forced to go out and call him in to supper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not the public scavenger, are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cleanliness is a commandment of the Lord!” Don
Mario would reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, having washed his hands, he sat down to the meagre
supper of onion salad and bread as if it had been the
daintiest of dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is Donna Rosa’s oil; and do you know there is
no more left?” said Don Ignazio one evening between two
mouthfuls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow I will go to the Cavaliere!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But his father was a peasant farmer!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His grandfather was a day labourer!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now he is made of money!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His grandfather became the Prince’s agent—and made
his fortune.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us go to bed; the light is going out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had to economise even their candles. But afterwards,
in the dark, the interrupted conversation was continued—not
very consecutively—from one bed to another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you seen the band in their new uniforms?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.... Farmer Cola has got in a hundred bushels of
grain this year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who knows if it is true? Much good may it do him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow I will go to the Cavaliere for some oil.”...</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wine is all gone, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will go for the wine as well.... <em>Ave Maria!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Pater Noster!</em>” And so they went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>In the morning, after carefully brushing his shabby and
much-mended coat and his rusty hat, Don Mario dressed
hastily and began his day by going to mass at San
Francesco.... This ceremony over, he proceeded on his
errand, hugging the oil-flask tightly under his coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>He presented himself with humble and ceremonious
courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the Cavaliere at home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but his lady is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Announce me to the lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now all the domestics in the place knew perfectly well
the meaning of a visit from Don Mario, and at most houses
they would leave him to wait in the anteroom, or say to
him without more ado—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me the bottle, Don Mario.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It often happened that while they were filling it for him
he could not control himself at the sight of the disorder in
the room where they left him. He would mount a chair in
order to remove, with the end of his stick, the cobwebs
clustering on the ceiling; and if he found a broom within
reach of his hand—what was to be done? he could not
resist!—he began to sweep the floor, to dust the pictures,
or to pick up the scraps of paper or stuff scattered about.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you doing, Don Mario?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lord has commanded us to be clean.... Thank
the lady for me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Donna Rosa, who was amused with him and his ways,
always had him shown up to the drawing-room, and asked
him to sit down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How are you, dear Don Mario?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, thank God. And how is your Excellency?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As well as most old women, dear Don Mario!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None are old but those that die. Your Excellency is
so charitable, that you ought to be spared for a hundred
years to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Donna Rosa kept up the conversation as though she had
no idea of the real object of this visit; and Don Mario, still
hugging his bottle, awaited the favourable moment for
presenting his request without appearing troublesome.
From time to time, after wriggling on his chair, as if in
pain, for a few minutes, he would rise, and with “Excuse
me, my lady!” wipe the dust from a table, or stoop to pick
up a flake of wool, or bit of thread from the floor, and throw
it out of the window,—as though the sight of these things
actually made him feel ill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! never mind, Don Mario!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lord has commanded us to be clean.... I had
come....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How does your brother like his new employment?”
Donna Rosa interrupted him, one day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very much indeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought to try and get appointed inspector of weights
yourself. There is one wanted at the Archi mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the addition, madam! the addition! Ignazio knows
how to do it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned up his eyes, with a sigh—as if this arithmetical
process were a most complicated calculation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor Ignazio!” he went on. “He comes back from
the mill so tired! Just imagine, madam—four miles uphill,
on foot!... I had come for this....”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he produced the flask.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With pleasure!” Who was there that could say “No”
to Don Mario?</p>

<p class='c009'>But when that unfortunate addition was mentioned, not
even the gift of a bottle of wine could restore him to good
humour. He had tried so many times to do an addition
sum. The tens were the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nine and one are ten.... Very good!... But&#160;...
put down nought and carry one.... Why carry one if
there are ten?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>He had found it utterly impossible to understand this.
And yet he was no fool. You should have heard him read,
quite correctly, all those old legal documents, with their
strange Latin abbreviations, which the modern notaries and
advocates could not succeed in deciphering. It is true that
he recited them parrot-fashion, without understanding them;
but all the same he could earn half a franc at a time when
required for this service; and this meant two <em>litres</em> of wine
and half a <em>kilo</em> of lamb—quite a festive meal, although,
nowadays, with Don Ignazio’s position, the two brothers
were not quite so badly off as before.</p>

<p class='c009'>They would even have been happy if it had not been for
the irritating behaviour of the street boys. One day matters
reached a crisis. Don Mario, administering a cuff to an
ill-conditioned fellow who assaulted him with the cry of
<em>Quacquarà</em>, received the same back with interest, and got his
coat torn into the bargain. The magistrate, before whom
the case was brought, kept the vagabond under arrest for a
couple of hours, and got up a subscription at the Casino, to
present Don Mario with a new coat and hat. But the
latter would never consent to be measured for it, and when
the coat—cut out by guess-work—was sent him, together
with the most spick and span of hats, he thanked the
donors politely, and sent the whole back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have been a fool!” said his brother, who, on his
return from the mill that evening, found him intent on
repairing his ancient garment. “You can’t go out again
in that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall stay at home,” replied Don Mario loftily.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he was no longer seen about the town.</p>

<p class='c009'>He passed his days sitting on the front doorstep, talking
to the neighbours, or wandering through the many empty
rooms of the dilapidated house. No repairs had been
undertaken for years past; the shutters were loose on their
hinges. Two floors had given way, and had to be passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>by means of planks, laid like bridges from one room to
another; and the tiles were off the roof in many places, so
that some of the upper rooms were flooded when it rained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sell half the house,” said one of the neighbours; “it is
much too large for you two alone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But that evening, discussing the matter at supper, Don
Mario and Don Ignazio found themselves greatly embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sell! Easily said.... But what? The room that had
been their father’s office?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Don Mario indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is true that the big volumes, bound in dark leather,
were no longer in the shelves all round the walls. The
government had taken possession of them, as though they
had been its property, and not that of the notaries, who had
drawn up all those documents. But what matter? The
shelves, moth-eaten and rickety, reduced to receptacles for
dishes, frying-pans, and utensils of all sorts, remained, to
their eyes, living witnesses, as it were, to past glories. The
two brothers looked at one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was it possible?... Well.... What <em>should</em> they
sell? Their grandmother’s room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A mysterious chamber, which had been kept locked for
seventy years, and of which now even the key was lost.
Their grandfather’s wife—a saint on earth—had died there,
and the widower had ordered it to be shut up, in sign of
perpetual mourning. Every night the mice kept up a
terrible racket there. But what matter? A master notary—one
of the Majori—had willed that no one should open
it and no one had done so. Were <em>they</em> to profane it?
They were both agreed&#160;... it was impossible!</p>

<p class='c009'>“What then? The portrait-room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There were arranged on its walls half-a-dozen canvases,
blackened with years and smoke, on which you could make
out—here, the severe profile of Don Gasparo Majori, 1592;
there, the grey eyes, white moustache, and pointed beard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of Don Carlo, 1690; beside it, the wig and round shaven
face of Don Paolo, 1687; and further on, the lean and
narrow head of Don Antonio, 1805, framed in an enormous
collar, with white neckcloth, and showy waistcoat with
watch-chain and seals dangling from its pockets. Don
Mario knew by heart the life, death, and miracles of each
one, and so did Don Ignazio.</p>

<p class='c009'>Could they turn them out of their own house? No; it
was impossible. Better let the whole fall into ruins.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went to bed and put out the light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it will last our time. We are old, Mario!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are two years older than I!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“... To-morrow, Notary Patrizio is coming to get an
old deed read out to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So we shall be able to buy half a <em>kilo</em> of meat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saverio the butcher cheats in his weights. I shall keep
my eyes open.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have lent the rolling-pin to Comare Nina.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will get the wine from Scatá.... Vittoria wine this
time.... <em>Pater Noster!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Ave Maria!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were growing old. Ignazio was right.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Mario sometimes wondered which of the two would
die first, and the thought left him sad and depressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am the younger.... But, after me, the house will go
to distant relatives,&#160;... they will divide it up and sell it....
But, after all, what does it matter to us? We shall
both be gone then.... We are the real Majori; when we
are dead, the world is dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet he went on sweeping out the tumble-down old house
with the same tenderness and care as ever, removing the
cobwebs from the walls, and dusting the moth-eaten and
ragged remnants of furniture; driving a nail into the back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of a chair or the leg of a table; pasting a sheet of oiled
paper in the place of a missing window-pane, and carrying
out the dust and rubbish as usual, late at night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moreover, since he now frequently went to sleep in the
daytime—with the loneliness, and having nothing to do—he
sometimes passed the night out of doors, sweeping the
whole length and breadth of the street, and pleased to hear
the wonder of the neighbourhood next morning, and have
people say to him—</p>

<p class='c009'>“The angel passed by last night. Is it so, Don Mario?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He would smile, without replying. He was now quite
resigned to his voluntary imprisonment, as he could no
longer wear his old coat and hat, which were still there,
quite spotless and free from dust, though perfectly useless.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day, however, Don Mario lost all his peace of
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Standing at a window in the portrait-room, he had
been looking along the street at Reina’s house, with
its fantastically-sculptured gateway and the twisted stone
monsters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A fine palace—quite a royal one,” said Don Mario, who
had never seen anything richer or more beautiful in his
life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet, how was it the proprietor had never noticed those
tufts of pellitory growing between the carvings over the arch
of the great gateway, quite spoiling the building? It was a
sin and a shame!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely had Don Ignazio come home from the mill that
evening, tired and out of breath, when his brother said to
him—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here; you ought to go to Signor Reina. He is
letting nasty weeds grow between the carvings of the gateway,
under the middle balcony. It quite worries one to see
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“You ought to tell him of it—at least when you meet
him again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Ignazio, quite worn out with his long walk, had
other matters to think of; he wanted to have his supper
and go to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But from that day he too got no peace. Every evening,
when he came home, Don Mario never failed to ask him,
even before he had laid aside his stick: “Have you spoken
to Reina?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go and tell him at once. It is a pity; those weeds are
spoiling the building.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were quite an eyesore to him; he could not make
out how Reina could put up with such a sacrilege. And
several times a day he would go to the attic window,
mounting a pair of steps at the risk of his neck, in order
to look out. Those weeds were always there! They grew
from day to day; they made great bushes that waved in the
wind. If they had been fungous growths in the interior of
his own system, he could not have suffered more from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you told Reina about them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He swore at me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That night Don Mario never closed his eyes. As soon
as he found that his brother was snoring, then he lit the
lamp, dressed himself, took the steps on his shoulder, which
they nearly dislocated, and made his way to Reina’s house,
keeping in the shadow of the wall, and avoiding the moonlight,
as if he had been a burglar.</p>

<p class='c009'>As indeed the gendarmes thought him when they came
upon him, perched on the top of the gateway, pulling away
for dear life at the parasitic herbs, in spite of the proprietor,
who did not care whether they grew there or not.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“What are you doing up there?”</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_133.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I am pulling

<p class='c009'>“Come down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me finish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come down,
I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this unceremonious
summons
poor Don
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Mario had to descend, leaving several bushes of pellitory to
spoil the beautiful building unchecked....</p>

<p class='c009'>They were nearly taking him off to the police station!...
And all for a good action! He died within three months,
with the nightmare of those weeds weighing on his heart....
Poor old Don Mario!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE EXCAVATIONS OF MASTRO ROCCO.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Ever since he had taken it into his head to “take off
the charm,” in the <em>Grotto of the Seven Gates</em>, Mastro
Rocco had given up his pork-butcher’s shop, and was always
on the top of the hill, baking his hump-back in the sun,
digging here and there from morning to night, to find some
trace of the treasure which the Saracens had enchanted in
that neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mastro Rocco used to talk as though he had seen it with
his little red-rimmed eyes, and touched it with the horny
hands which now wielded the spade both day and night,
excavating ancient tombs,—by day on his own little plot of
ground which looked like the destruction of Jerusalem—all
yawning holes and heaps of earth;—by night, on his neighbours’
farms, by moonlight, or by that of a lantern, when
there was no moon; for the neighbours did not like their
ground cut up, and laughed at his finds of useless earthen
vessels, and old coins with which you could not even buy a
pennyworth of bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mastro Rocco laughed to himself at these ignorant rustics
who understood nothing. <em>He</em> knew, and had proved it,
that those earthen vases, especially if they had figures on
them, and that oxidised money, could be speedily converted
into good coin of the realm, when he carried them to Baron
Padullo, who put on his spectacles to examine them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>then opened certain huge books, as big as missals, and full
of pictures, to make comparisons. Thus he had become
convinced that the trade of selling ham and sausages was
far inferior to that of digging up antiquities....</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>One day he found some beautiful terra-cotta figures, for
which the baron paid him ten <i><span lang="it">scudi</span></i>. Who could tell what
they might be worth, when the old gentleman could bring
himself to give as much as that.</p>

<p class='c009'>After that he went much more frequently to the baron’s
house, accompanied by a little old man, whom Mastro
Rocco called his assistant. But they always brought figures
exactly like the first ones, all soiled with the earth they had
been dug from; and at last, one day, the baron said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mastro Rocco, if you do not find something different,
you might as well save yourself the trouble of coming.
Look here, I have a whole cupboard full of these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pointed to a number of statuettes of Ceres, seated
with her hands on her knees, arranged in rows behind the
glass doors, along with Greek vases, lamps, bronzes of every
sort, and antique coins of every size....</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a long time before Mastro Rocco was seen again
at the baron’s. When he next presented himself, along
with the little old man, he carefully set down a basket full
of hay which he had carried up under his arm, and began
to gesticulate vehemently as he pointed out the precious
objects reposing in the basket and covered with the
hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! <i><span lang="it">signor barone!</span></i> what a novelty! what a novelty!
Your worship will be enchanted, upon my word of honour!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The baron had put on his spectacles in order the better
to admire; and when he saw some half-dozen figures of
Ceres, exactly like the others, but with unmistakable pipes
in their mouths, instead of being enchanted, he roared
aloud—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Ah! Mastro Rocco, you thief! Ah! you scoundrel!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he would have put a pistol-bullet through the head
of each if they had not jumped from the window regardless
of possible broken necks; though, after all, it was not very
high. Mastro Rocco only broke his arm, and had a mass
said to his patron saint for assistance rendered in this
extremity. With his arm in a sling he imprecated curses
on his rascally partner, who had suggested the charming
novelty of the pipes!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE WAR OF THE SAINTS.</em></h2>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_137.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>All of a sudden, while San
Rocco was quietly proceeding
on his way, under his
baldachin, with a number of
wax candles lit all round him,
and the band, and the procession,
and the crowd of devout
people—there came to pass a
general helter-skelter, tumult,
and confusion worse confounded.
There were priests
running away, with the skirts
of their cassocks flying wildly,
drummers and fifers upset on
their faces, women screaming,
blood flowing in streams, and
cudgels playing even under
the very nose of the blessed
San Rocco. The Prætor, the
Syndic, the Carbineers all
hastened to the spot;—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>broken bones were carried off to the hospital,—a few of
the more riotous members of the community were marched
off to pass the night in prison,—the saint returned to his
church at a run rather than a processional step,—and the
festival ended like the comedies of Pulcinella.</p>

<p class='c009'>And all this through the spite of the people in the parish
of San Pasquale. That year the pious souls of San Rocco
had been spending the very eyes out of their heads in order
to do things in grand style;—they had sent for the band from
town,—they had let off more than two thousand squibs,—and
they had now got a new banner, all embroidered with
gold, which, it was said, weighed over a quintal, and tossed
up and down in the midst of the crowd, like a wave crested
with golden foam. Which thing, by sheer contrivance of
the Evil One, was a thorn in the sides of the followers of
S. Pasquale,—so that one of the latter at last lost patience,
and began, pale as death, to yell at the top of his voice,
“<i><span lang="it">Viva San Pasquale!</span></i>” Then it was that the cudgels began
to fly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Because, after all, to go and cry “<i><span lang="it">Viva San Pasquale</span></i>” in
the very face of San Rocco, is really a good, sound, indisputable
provocation;—it is just like going and spitting in a
man’s house, or amusing yourself by pinching the girl who is
walking arm in arm with him. In such a case there is no
longer any sense of right and wrong,—and that slight amount
of respect which people still have for the other saints—who,
after all, are all related to each other—is trampled under
foot. If it happens in church, seats are flung into the air,—if
during a procession, there are showers of torch stumps
like swarms of bats, and at table the dishes fly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it">Santo diavolone!</span></i>” cried Compare Nino, panting, heated,
and dishevelled. “I’d like to know who has the face to
cry <i><span lang="it">Viva San Pasquale</span></i> again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I!” yelled Turi the tanner, who looked forward to
being his brother-in-law, quite beside himself with rage, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>nearly blinded by a chance blow received in the <i><span lang="fr">mêlée</span></i>.
“<i><span lang="it">Viva San Pasquale</span></i> till death!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the love of Heaven! for the love of Heaven!”
shrieked his sister Saridda, throwing herself between her
brother and her betrothed. All three had been going for a
walk in all love and good fellowship up to that moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Compare Nino, the expectant bridegroom, kept crying in
derision, “Long live my boots—<i><span lang="it">viva San Stivale!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take that!” howled Turi, foaming at the mouth,
his eyes swollen and his face like a tomato. “Take that
for San Rocco, you and your boots! There!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In this way they exchanged blows which would have felled
an ox, till their friends succeeded in separating them by dint
of cuffs and kicks. Saridda, who by this time had grown
excited on her own account, now cried <i><span lang="it">Viva San Pasquale</span></i>,
and was very nearly coming to blows with her lover, as if
they had already been husband and wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>At such times parents quarrel most desperately with their
sons and daughters, and wives separate from their husbands,
if by misfortune a woman of the parish of San Pasquale has
married a man from San Rocco.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t hear another word about that man!” cried
Saridda, standing with her hands on her hips, to the neighbours,
when they asked her how it happened that the
marriage had not come off. “I won’t have him, if they
give him to me dressed in gold and silver from head to foot!
Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saridda may stay where she is till she turns mouldy, for
all I care!” said Compare Nino, in his turn, as he was
getting the blood washed from his face at the public-house.
“A parcel of beggars and cowards, over in the tanner’s
quarter! I must have been drunk when it came into my
head to look for a sweetheart over there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since it is this way,” had been the Syndic’s conclusion,
“and they can’t carry a saint out into the square without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>sticks and fighting, so that it’s perfectly beastly,—I will have
no more festivals, nor processions, nor services; and if they
bring out so much as one single candle—what you may call
a candle—I’ll have them every one in gaol.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In time, the matter became important; for the bishop
of the diocese had granted to the priests of San Pasquale
the privilege of wearing copes. The parishioners of San
Rocco, whose priests had no copes, had even gone to
Rome to raise an outcry at the foot of the Holy Father,
carrying with them documents on stamped paper, and everything
else; but all had been in vain, for their adversaries of
the lower town—who, as every one remembered, had once
been without shoes to their feet—had now grown as rich as
Jews, through this new industry of tanning. And, in this
world, one knows that justice is bought and sold like the
soul of Judas.</p>

<p class='c009'>At San Pasquale they were awaiting Monsignor’s delegate,
who was a person of importance, and had silver buckles
on his shoes weighing half a pound apiece—and a fine sight
they were to see—and he was coming to bring the copes
to the canons. And for this reason, they, in their turn,
had now sent for the band, and they were going to meet
Monsignor’s delegate three miles outside the town; and it
was said that in the evening there were to be fireworks in
the square, with <i><span lang="it">Viva San Pasquale</span></i> over and over again, in
letters as big as those on a shop-front.</p>

<p class='c009'>The inhabitants of the upper town were therefore in a
great ferment; and some, more excited than others, were
trimming certain staves of pear and cherry wood, as big as
clothes-props, and muttering—</p>

<p class='c009'>“If there is to be music, we shall want to beat time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Bishop’s delegate ran a great risk of coming out of
his triumphal entry with broken bones. But the reverend
gentleman was cunning enough to leave the band waiting
for him outside the town, while he, taking a short cut,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>quietly walked to the parish priest’s house, whither he
summoned the principal men of the two parties.</p>

<p class='c009'>When these gentlemen found themselves face to face—after
all this time that the feud had lasted—each man began
to look into the whites of his neighbour’s eyes, as if he
could scarcely keep his nails out of them; and it required
all the authority of his Reverence—who had put on his
new cloth soutane for the occasion—to get the ices and the
other refreshments served without accidents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s right!” said the Syndic approvingly, with his
nose in his glass. “When you want me for the cause of
peace, you’ll always find me on the spot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The delegate, in fact, said that he had come for the sake
of conciliation, with the olive-branch in his mouth, like
Noah’s dove, and made his exhortation, distributing smiles
and hand-clasps all round, and saying, “Gentlemen, will
you do me the favour of coming into the sacristy to take a
cup of chocolate on the day of the festival?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do leave the festival alone!” said the Vice-Prætor;
“if not, more mischief will come of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mischief will come of it if this tyranny is to be allowed—if
a man is not to be free to amuse himself as he likes, and pay
for it with his own money!” exclaimed Bruno, the carter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wash my hands of the matter. The orders of the
Government are explicit. If you celebrate the festival I
shall send for the Carbineers. I am for order.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will answer for order!” said the Syndic, tapping the
ground for emphasis with his umbrella, and looking slowly
around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bravo! as if we did not know that it is your brother-in-law
Bruno who blows the bellows for you in the Town
Council!” retorted the Vice-Prætor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you have joined the opposition party only on
account of that bye-law about the washing, which you can’t
get over!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“Gentlemen! gentlemen!” entreated the delegate. “We
shall do nothing if we go on in this way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have a revolution, that we will!” shouted Bruno,
gesticulating with his hands in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately the parish priest had quietly put away the
cups and glasses, and the sacristan had rushed off at the top
of his speed to dismiss the band, who, having heard of the
delegate’s arrival, were already hastening up to welcome
him, blowing their cornets and clarionets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In this way we shall do nothing at all!” muttered the
delegate, worried to death by the thought that the harvest
was already ripe for cutting in his own village, while he was
wasting his time here talking to Compare Bruno and the
Vice-Prætor, who were ready to tear one another’s souls out.
“What is this story about the prohibition of the washing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The usual interference. Nowadays one can’t hang a
handkerchief out of the window to dry without getting fined
for it. The Vice-Prætor’s wife—feeling safe because her
husband was in a position of trust, for till now people always
had some little regard for the authorities—used to hang out
the whole week’s washing—it was not much to boast of—on
the terrace.... But now, under the new law, that’s a
mortal sin; and now even the dogs and fowls are prohibited,
and the other animals<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a>—saving your presence—that used to
do the scavenging in the streets; and now the first rain
that comes it will be Heaven’s mercy if we don’t all get
smothered in the filth. The real truth is that Bruno, the
assessor, has a grudge against the Vice-Prætor, on account
of a certain decision he has given against him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The delegate, in order to conciliate the local mind, used
to sit boxed up in his confessional, like an owl in its nest,
from morning till evening, and all the women were eager to
be shriven by the Bishop’s representative, who had powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>of plenary absolution for all sorts of sins, just as though he
had been Monsignor in person.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your Reverence,” said Saridda, with her nose at the
grating, “Compare Nino makes me commit sin every Sunday
in church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In what way, my daughter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was to have married me, before there was all this
talk in the place; but now that the marriage is broken off,
he goes and stands near the high altar, and stares at me,
and laughs with his friends, all the time holy mass is going
on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when his Reverence tried to touch Nino’s heart the
countryman replied—</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it is she who turns her back on me whenever she
sees me—just as if I were a beggar!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He, on the other hand, if Gnà Saridda passed across the
square on Sundays, gave himself airs as if he had been the
brigadier, or some other great personage, and did not even
seem to see her. Saridda was exceedingly busy preparing
little coloured paper-lanterns, and put them out in a row on
the window-sill, in his very face, under the pretext of hanging
them out to dry. Once they found themselves together in
church, at a christening, and took no notice of each other,
just as though they had never met before; nay, Saridda even
Went so far as to flirt with the godfather.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A poor sort of a godfather!” sneered Nino. “Why the
child’s a girl! And when a girl is born, even the beams of
the roof break down!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saridda turned away, and pretended to be talking to the
baby’s mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s bad does not always come to do harm. Sometimes,
when you think you’ve lost a treasure, you ought to
thank God and St. Pasquale; for you can never say you
know a person till you have eaten seven measures of salt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, one must take troubles as they come, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>worst possible way is to worry one’s self about things which
are not worth the trouble. When one Pope’s dead they
make another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s fore-ordained what sort of natures children are to
be born with, and it’s just like that with marriages. It’s
far better to marry a man who really cares for you and has
no other ends to serve, even though he has no money or
fields, or mules or anything.”...</p>

<p class='c009'>On the square the drum was beating to give notice of the
festival.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Syndic says we shall have the festival,” was the
murmur that went through the crowd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go to law till doomsday, if it should leave me as
poor as holy Job, with nothing left but my shirt; but that
five francs’ fine I will not pay! not if I had to leave
directions about it in my will!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confound it all!” exclaimed Nino. “What sort of a
festival are they going to have, if we are all to die of hunger
this year?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Since March not a drop of rain had fallen, and the
yellow corn, which crackled like tinder, was “dying of
thirst.” Bruno, the carter, however, said that when San
Pasquale was carried out in procession it would rain for
certain. But what did he care about rain? or all the
tanners of his neighbourhood either? In fact they carried
San Pasquale in procession to east and to west, and set him
upon a hill to bless the country on a stifling May day, when
the sky was covered with clouds,—one of those days when
the farmers are ready to tear their hair before the burnt-up
fields, and the ears of corn droop as if they were dying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A curse on San Pasquale!” cried Nino, spitting in the
air, and rushing about among his crops like a madman.
“You have ruined me, San Pasquale; you’ve left me nothing
but the reaping-hook to cut my throat with!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The upper town was a desolate place enough. It was one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of those long years when the hunger begins in June, and the
women stand at their doors with their hair hanging about
their shoulders—doing nothing—staring with fixed eyes.
Gnà Saridda, hearing that Compare Nino’s mule was to be
sold in the public square, to pay the rent of his farm, felt
her anger melt away in an instant, and sent her brother Turi
in hot haste, with the few <i><span lang="it">soldi</span></i> they had put aside, to help
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nino was in one corner of the square, with his eyes
averted and his hands in his pockets, while they were
selling his mule, with all its ornaments and the new headstall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want anything,” he replied sullenly. “My arms
are still left me, please God. A fine saint that San Pasquale
of yours, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Turi turned his back on him, to avoid unpleasantness,
and went on his way. But the truth is that people’s minds
were thoroughly exasperated, now that they had carried San
Pasquale in procession to east and west, with no more result
than that. The worst of it was that many from the parish
of San Rocco had been induced to walk with the procession
too, thrashing themselves like asses, and with crowns of thorns
on their heads, for the sake of their crops. Now they
relieved their feelings in exceedingly bad language; and the
Bishop’s delegate was obliged to leave the town, as he
entered it, on foot, and without the band.</p>

<p class='c009'>The vice-prætor, by way of retaliation on his opponent,
telegraphed that people’s minds were excited, and the public
peace compromised; so that one fine day a report went
through the town, that the soldiers had arrived, and every
one could go and see them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They have come on account of the cholera,” others;
said, however. “Down in the city, they say, the people are
dying like flies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chemist put up the chain of his shop door, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>doctor left the place as speedily as possible, to escape being
knocked on the head.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“It will not come to anything,” said the few who had
remained in the place, having been unable to fly into the
country like the rest. “The blessed San Rocco will watch
over his own town.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the lower town folks had begun to go barefoot to
San Rocco’s church. But not long after that, deaths began
to come thick and fast. They said of one man that he was
a glutton, and died of eating too many prickly pears, and of
another, that he had come in from the country after nightfall.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
But, in short, there was the cholera, there was no disguising it,—in
spite of the soldiers, and in the very teeth of San Rocco,—notwithstanding
the fact that an old woman in the odour of
sanctity had dreamed that the saint himself had said to her—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have no fear of the cholera, for I am looking after that.
I am not like that useless old ass of a San Pasquale.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nino and Turi had not met since the mule was sold; but
scarcely had the former heard that the brother and sister
were both ill, than he hastened to their house, and found
Saridda, black in the face, and her features all distorted, in a
corner of the room. Her brother, who was with her, was
recovering, but could not tell what to do for her, and was
nearly beside himself with despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! thief of a San Rocco,” groaned Nino. “I never
expected this. Gnà Saridda, don’t you know me any more?
Nino, your old friend Nino.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saridda looked at him with eyes so sunken that one had
to hold a lantern to her face before one could see them, and
Nino felt his own running over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! San Rocco,” said he, “this is a worse trick than
the one San Pasquale played me!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>However, Saridda in time got better, and as she was
standing at the door, with her head tied up in a handkerchief,
and her face yellow as new wax, she said to Nino—</p>

<p class='c009'>“San Rocco has worked a miracle for me, and you ought
to come too, and carry a candle at his festival.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nino’s heart was too full to speak, and he nodded assent.
But before the festival came round, he too was taken with
the pestilence, and lay at the point of death. Saridda tore
her face with her nails, and said that she wanted to die
with him, and she would cut off her hair and have it buried
with him, and no one should ever look her in the face again
as long as she lived.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_147.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“No, no,” replied Nino, his face all drawn with agony.
“Your hair will grow again, but it will be I that will never
see you again, for I shall be dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A fine miracle that San Rocco has worked for you!”
said Turi, by way of comforting him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both of them slowly recovered; and when they sat
sunning themselves, with their backs to the wall and very
long faces, kept throwing San Rocco and San Pasquale in
each other’s teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day Bruno, the carter, coming back from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>country after the cholera was over, passed by them, and
said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re going to have a grand festival to thank San
Pasquale for having saved us from the cholera. We shall
have no more demagogues and no more opposition, now,
that the vice-prætor is dead. He has left the quarrel
behind him in his will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All very well; a festival for the dead!” sneered Nino.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it was San Rocco that kept you alive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There!—do have done with it!” cried Saridda. “If
you don’t, we shall need another cholera to make peace
between you!”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>He no longer went about now with the long beard and
scapulary of the begging friar. He got shaved every
Sunday, and went for a walk in his best soutane of fine cloth,
with his silk-lined cloak over his arm. When he looked at his
fields, his vineyards, his cattle, and his ploughmen, with his
hands in his pockets and his pipe in his mouth, if he had
remembered the time when he washed up the dishes for the
Capuchin fathers, and they put him into the frock out of
charity, he would have crossed himself with his left hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if they had not taught him, for charity’s sake, to read
and write and say mass, he would never have succeeded in
fixing himself in the best property in the village, nor in
getting into his books the names of all those tenants who
worked away and prayed for a good harvest for him, and
then blasphemed like Turks when settling-day came round.
“Look at what I am, and don’t ask who my parents were,”
says the proverb. As for his parents, every one knew about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>them; his mother swept out the house for him. His
Reverence was not ashamed of his family—not he; and
when he went to play at cards with the Baroness, he made
his brother wait for him in the anteroom, with the big lantern
to light him home with.... He was popular as a confessor,
and always ready for a little paternal gossip with his female
penitents, after they had relieved their consciences and
emptied their pockets, of their own and other people’s sins.
You could always pick up some useful information, especially
if you were given to speculating in agricultural matters,
in return for your blessing!</p>

<p class='c009'>Good gracious! He did not pretend to be a saint—not
he! Holy men usually died of hunger—like the vicar, who
celebrated, even when his masses were not paid for, and
went about poor people’s houses in a ragged soutane which
was a perfect scandal to religion. His Reverence wanted to
get on, and get on he did, with the wind right aft, though a
little hampered at first by that unlucky monk’s frock, which
would get in his way, till he escaped from it by means of a
suit before the Royal Courts. The rest of the brethren
backed him up in his application, only for the sake of
getting rid of him; for, as long as he was in the monastery,
there was a free fight in the refectory every time a new
Provincial had to be elected, and the forms and dishes flew
about with such goodwill that Father Battistino, who was
sturdy as a muleteer, had been half-killed, and Father Giammaria,
the guardian, had had his teeth knocked down his
throat. His Reverence, after having stirred up the fire all
he could, always retired to his cell on those occasions, and
remained quiet there; and it was in this way that he had
succeeded in becoming “His Reverence” with a complete
set of teeth, which served him exceedingly well; while of
Father Giammaria, who had been the man to get that
scorpion up his sleeve, every one said: “Serves him right!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Father Giammaria was still only guardian of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Capuchins, without a shirt to his back or a sou in his
pocket,—hearing confessions for the love of God, and
making soup for the poor.</p>

<p class='c009'>When his Reverence was a boy, and saw his brother—the
one who now carried the lantern—breaking his back
with digging, and his sisters finding no husbands who would
take them even at a gift, and his mother spinning in the
dark to save lamp-oil, he said, “I want to be a priest.”
His family sold their mule and their little plot of ground to
send him to school, in the hope that if ever they attained to
having a priest in the house, they would get something
better than the land and the mule. But more than that
was required to keep him at the seminary. Then the boy
began to hang about the monastery, hoping to be taken on
as a novice; and one day when the Provincial was expected,
and they were busy in the kitchen, they called him
in to help. Father Giammaria, a kind-hearted old fellow,
said to him, “Would you like to stay here?—so you shall.”
And Fra Carmelo, the porter—who was bored to death,
sitting for hours on the cloister wall, with nothing to do,
swinging one sandal against the other—patched him up a
scapulary out of old rags which had been hung out on
the fig-tree to scare away the sparrows. His mother, his
brother, and sister protested that if he became a monk it
was all up with them—they would lose the money they had
paid for his schooling, and never get a brass farthing out of
him in return. But he shrugged his shoulders and replied,
“It’s a fine thing if a man is not to follow the vocation to
which God has called him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Father Giammaria had taken a fancy to him because he was
active and handy in the kitchen, and at all other work; and
served mass as though he had never done anything else in
his life, with his eyes cast down, and his lips primmed up like
a seraph. Now that he no longer served the mass, he still
had the same downcast eye and compressed lips, when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>was a question of some scandal among the gentry, or of
the common lands being put up to auction, or of swearing
the truth before the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one dared to go to law with him; and if he cast his
eyes on a farm for sale, or on a lot of the common land up
at auction, the magnates of the place themselves, if they
ventured to bid against him, did so with obsequious bows,
offering him pinches of snuff. One day he and no less
a person than the Baron himself were at it a whole day—pull
devil, pull baker. The Baron was doing the amiable,
and his Reverence, seated opposite to him, with his cloak
gathered up between his legs, at every advance in the
bidding offered him his silver snuff-box, sighing, “What
are you going to do about it, Baron?” At last the lot was
knocked down to him, and the Baron took his pinch of
snuff, green with vexation.</p>

<p class='c009'>This sort of thing quite met the views of the peasants;
they were used to seeing the big dogs fight among themselves
over a good bone, and leave nothing for the little
ones to gnaw. But what made them complain was that this
man of God ground them down worse than the very Antichrist,
when they had to share the crops with him; and he
had no scruples about seizing his neighbour’s goods, because
the apparatus of the confessional was all in his hands, and if
he fell into mortal sin he could easily give himself absolution.
“It is everything to have the priest in one’s own
house,” they sighed. And the shrewdest of them denied
themselves the very bread out of their mouths, so as to send
one of their sons to the seminary.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When one gives himself up to the land, one has to do
it altogether,” his Reverence used to say, as an excuse for
considering no one. The mass itself he only celebrated on
Sundays, except when there was nothing else to do; he was
not one of those wretched starveling priests who have to
run after the three <i><span lang="it">tari</span></i> of the mass fee. He had no need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of it. So much so that the Bishop, arriving at his house on
a pastoral visit, and finding his breviary covered with dust,
wrote thereon with his finger, “<i><span lang="it">Deo gratias!</span></i>” But his
Reverence had other things to think of besides wasting his
time in reading the breviary, and laughed at the Bishop’s
reproof. If the breviary was covered with dust, his oxen
were sleek and shining, his sheep were thick in fleece, and
the crops as tall as a man, so that his tenants, at any rate,
could enjoy the sight of them, and build fine castles in the air—till
they had to settle accounts with their landlord. It was
a relief to their hearts, poor souls. “Crops that are like
witchcraft! The Lord must have passed by them in the
night! One can see that they belong to a man of God,
and it is a good thing to work for him who has the mass
and the blessing in his hand!” In May, at the season
when they watched the sky with anxious looks for every
passing cloud, they knew that their landlord was saying
mass for the harvest, and was a better protection against
the Evil Eye and the bad season than pictures of saints or
blessed loaves. As for the latter, his Reverence would not
have them scattered about among the crops, because, as he
said, they only served to attract sparrows and other noxious
birds. Of sacred pictures he had his pockets full; he got as
many as he wanted, of the best kind, in the sacristy, without
spending a penny, and made presents of them to his
labourers.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at harvest-time he came riding up on horseback,
along with his brother, who acted as his bailiff, with his gun
over his shoulder, and never left the spot. He slept out in
the fields, in spite of the malaria, so as to look after his
interests, without troubling himself about God or man.
The poor wretches who, in the fine season, had forgotten
the hard days of the winter, remained open-mouthed, hearing
him run over the litany of their debts. “So many pounds
of beans that your wife came to fetch at the time of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>snow. So many faggots handed over to your son. So
many bushels of grain you have had in advance, for seed,
with interest, at so much a month. Now make up the
account.” A confused account enough. In that year of
dearth, when Uncle Carmenio had left his sweat and his
health in his Reverence’s fields, he was forced, when harvest
came, to leave his donkey there too, to pay his debts, and
went off empty-handed, with ugly words in his mouth—blasphemies
that were enough to freeze your very blood.
His Reverence, who was not there to hear confessions, let
him swear,—and led the ass into his own stable.</p>

<p class='c009'>But after 1860, when heresy had triumphed, what good
did all his power and influence do him? The country
people learning to read and write, and able to add up accounts
better than he himself; parties fighting for office in the
municipal government, and sharing the spoils without a consideration
in the world for any one but themselves; the next
beggar in the street able to get legal advice for nothing, if
he had a quarrel with you, and force you to pay the costs
alone! A priest was nothing whatever nowadays—either
for the judge or the militia captain; he could no longer, by
dropping a hint, get people imprisoned if they failed in
respect to him; in fact, he was good for nothing but to say
mass and hear confessions, just as though he were a servant
of the public. The judge was afraid of the papers—of
public opinion—of what Tom, Dick, and Harry would say—and
balanced his decisions like Solomon! They even
envied his Reverence the property he had acquired in the
sweat of his brow; they had “overlooked” him and cast
spells on him; the little he ate at dinner tortured him at
night; while his brother, who led a hard life and dined on
bread and garlic, had the digestion of an ostrich, and knew
very well that, in a hundred years’ time, when he, the priest,
was dead, he would be his heir, and find himself rich without
lifting a finger. His mother, poor body, was past work now—she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>survived only to suffer herself and be a trouble to other
people—helpless in her bed with paralysis; she had to be
waited on, instead of waiting on him. Everything went
wrong in these days.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no religion now—no justice—no anything!”
he would grumble, as he was growing old. “Now everybody
wants to have his say. Those who have nothing want
to grab your share. ‘Get out of that and let me get in!’
That’s it! They’d like to reduce the priests to sacristans—leave
them nothing to do but say mass and sweep out the
church. They don’t want to obey God’s commandments
any more—that’s what’s the matter with <em>them</em>!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>PADRON ’NTONI’S POLITICS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>... <span class='c014'>P</span>adron ’Ntoni knew nothing about politics, and
contented himself with minding his own affairs, for he
used to say, “He who has charge of a house cannot sleep
when he pleases,” and “He who commands has to give
account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In December 1863, ’Ntoni, the eldest of his grandsons,
had been called out for the naval conscription. Padron
’Ntoni went at once to all the big-wigs of the village,
thinking that they would be able to help him. But Don
Giammaria the priest said that it served him right, and
that this was the fruit of that revolution of Satan they had
brought about when they hoisted the tricolour on the church
tower. On the other hand, Don Franco the chemist began
to laugh under his great beard, and assured Padron ’Ntoni,
rubbing his hands, that as soon as they were able to rig up a
bit of a republic, which was what was wanted, every one who
had to do with the conscription and the taxes should be
kicked out; that there would then be no more soldiers, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>every man in the country would go to war if it were needed.
Then Padron ’Ntoni prayed and entreated him to get the
Republic made soon—before his grandson ’Ntoni had to go
for a soldier, just as though Don Franco had the Republic
in his pocket, insomuch that the chemist ended by losing
his temper. Then Don Silvestro, the Syndic’s secretary,
nearly killed himself with laughing, and said that a nice
little sum paid into the pockets of such and such personages
he knew of would have the effect of producing in ’Ntoni
some defect which would make him ineligible for service.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>MASTRO PEPPE’S MAGIC.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Mastro Peppe La Bravetta was a stout, stupid,
good-natured man, living in Pescara, who sold pots
and pans, and was terribly in awe of his wife, the severe and
miserly Donna Pelagia, who ruled him with a rod of iron.
Besides the income derived from his business, he possessed
a piece of land on the other side of the river which produced
enough to keep a pig. To this property the couple were
wont to repair every January, to preside over the killing and
salting of the pig which had been fattening through the
year.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_155.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Now one year it so happened that Pelagia was not very
well, and La Bravetta went to attend the execution alone.
And to him, in the course of the afternoon, came two of
his friends, graceless vagabonds, Matteo Puriello, nicknamed
Ciávola, who was a poacher, and Biagio Quaglia,
better known as Il Ristabilito, whose most serious occupation
was that of playing the guitar at weddings and on
other festive occasions.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he saw these two approaching he welcomed them
enthusiastically, and then, leading them into the building
where the wonderful pig was laid out on the table, asked—</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say to this, now? Isn’t he a beauty?
What do you think of him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The two friends contemplated the pig in silent wonder,
and Ristabilito clicked his tongue appreciatively against his
palate. Ciávola asked, “What are you going to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Salt it down,” replied La Bravetta, in a voice which
trembled with greedy delight of future banquets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Going to salt it?” cried Ristabilito suddenly. “Going
to salt it? But, Ciá, did you ever see any man so stupid as
this fellow? To let such a chance slip!”</p>

<p class='c009'>La Bravetta, quite dumfoundered, stared first at one and
then at the other with his calf-like eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Donna Pelagge has always kept you under her thumb,”
continued Ristabilito. “This time she can’t see you; why
shouldn’t you sell the pig, and then we’ll feast on the money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Pelagge?” stammered La Bravetta, who was filled
with an immense consternation by the image of his wrathful
wife presented to his mind’s eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell her that the pig was stolen,” said Ciávola, with a
gesture of impatience.</p>

<p class='c009'>La Bravetta shuddered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How am I to go home and tell her that? Pelagge
won’t believe me—she’ll drive me—she’ll&#160;... You don’t
know what Pelagge is!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
<img src='images/i_157.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Uh! Pelagge! uh! uh! Donna Pelagge!” jeered the
two arch-plotters in chorus. And then Ristabilito, imitating
Peppe’s whining voice, and his wife’s sharp and strident
one, acted a comic scene in which Peppe was utterly routed,
scolded, and finally cuffed like a naughty boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ciávola walked round the pig, scarcely able to move for
laughing. The unfortunate butt, seized with a violent fit of
sneezing, waved his arms helplessly, trying to interrupt the
dramatic representation. All the window-panes trembled
with the noise. The flaming sunset streamed in on three
very different human faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Ristabilito stopped, Ciávola said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let’s go away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you’ll stay to have supper——” began Mastro Peppe,
somewhat constrainedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, my dear boy,” interrupted Ciávola, as he turned
towards the door, “you do as Pelagge tells you, and salt
the pig.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the two friends walked along the road Ristabilito said
to Ciávola—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Compare</em>, shall we steal that pig to-night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?” said Ciávola.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know how, if they leave it where it was when we
saw it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let’s do it. But, then?” said Ciávola.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other’s whole face lit up, and fairly vibrated with a
grin of delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind—<em>I</em> know,” was all he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>They saw Don Bergamino Camplone coming along in the
moonlight—a black figure between the rows of leafless
poplars with their silvery trunks. They immediately quickened
their pace to meet him; and the jolly priest, seeing
their festive looks, asked with a smile—</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s up now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The friends briefly communicated their project to Don
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Bergamino, who assented with much cheerfulness. And
Ristabilito added, in a low voice—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we shall have to manage things cunningly. You
know that Peppe, ever since he took up with that ugly old
hag of a Donna Pelagge, has been getting very stingy, and
at the same time he’s very fond of wine. Now we must go
and fetch him and take him to Assaù’s tavern. You, Don
Bergamino, must treat us all round. Peppe will drink as
much as ever he can, seeing it costs him nothing, and will
get as drunk as a pig; and then——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The others agreed, and they went to Peppe’s house, which
was about two rifle-shots distant. When they were near
enough Ciávola lifted up his voice—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ohé! La Bravetta-a-a! Are you coming to Assaù’s?
The priest is here, and he’s going to pay for a bottle of
wine for us. Ohé-é-é!”</p>

<p class='c009'>La Bravetta was not long in descending, and all four set
off in a row, joking and laughing in the moonlight. In the
stillness the caterwauling of a distant cat was heard at
intervals, and Ristabilito remarked—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Pé! don’t you hear Pelagge calling you to come
back?”</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>They crossed the ferry, reached the tavern, and sat till
late over Assaù’s wine, which Mastro Peppe found so good
that he was at last discovered to be incapable of walking
home. They assisted him back to the house and left him to
go upstairs alone, which he did with some difficulty, talking
disconnectedly all the time about Lepruccio the butcher
and the quantity of salt needed for the pig, and quite oblivious
of the fact that he had left the door unfastened.
They waited a while, and then, entering softly, found the pig
on the table, and carried it off between them, shaking with
suppressed laughter. It was very heavy, and they were
quite out of breath when they reached the priest’s house.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>In the morning, Mastro Peppe having slept off his wine,
awoke, and lay still a little while on his bed, stretching his
limbs and listening to the bells as they rang for the Eve of
St. Anthony. Even in the confusion of his first awakening
he felt a contented sense of possession steal through his
mind, and tasted by anticipation the delight of seeing
Lepruccio cutting up and covering with salt the plump
joints of pork.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_160.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Under the impulse of this idea, he rose, and hurried out,
rubbing his eyes the while to get a better view. Nothing
was to be seen on the table but a stain of blood, with the
morning sun shining on it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The pig! Where is the pig?” cried the bereaved one
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c009'>A furious excitement seized upon him. He rushed
downstairs, saw the open door, struck his forehead with his
fists, and burst into the open air yelling aloud—calling all
his farm labourers round him, and asking them if they had
seen the pig—if they had taken it. He multiplied his complaints,
raising his voice more and more; and at last the
doleful sound, echoing along the river-bank, reached the
ears of Ciávola and Il Ristabilito.</p>

<p class='c009'>They therefore repaired to the spot at their ease, fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>agreed to enjoy the sight and keep up the joke. When they
came in sight, Mastro Peppe turned to them, all afflicted
and in tears, and exclaimed, “Oh! poor me! They have
stolen the pig! Oh! poor me! What shall I do?—what
shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Biagio Quaglia stood for a while, looking at this most
unhappy man out of his half-shut eyes, with an expression
midway between derision and admiration, and his head
inclined to one shoulder, as if critically judging of some
dramatic effort. Then he came closer and said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! yes, yes—one can’t deny it.... You play your
part well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Peppe, not understanding, lifted his face all furrowed with
the tracks of tears....</p>

<p class='c009'>“To tell the truth, I never thought you would have been
so cute,” Ristabilito went on. “Well done! Bravo! I’m
delighted!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that you’re saying?” asked La Bravetta between
his sobs. “What’s that you’re saying? Oh! poor me!
How can I ever go home again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bravo! bravo! that’s right!” insisted Ristabilito.
“Go on! Yell harder!—cry!—tear your hair! Make
them hear! That’s it! Make them believe it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Peppe, still weeping—</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I say they have really and truly stolen it! Oh,
dear! oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s it! Go on! Don’t stop! Again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Peppe, quite beside himself with exasperation and grief,
redoubled his asseverations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m telling the truth! May I die now, at once, if they
haven’t stolen that pig from me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, poor innocent!” jeered Ciávola. “Put your
finger in your eye! How can we believe you, when we
saw the pig here yesterday evening? Has St. Anthony
given him wings to fly away with?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Oh, blessed St. Anthony! It is just as I say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! oh! oh! It is! it is! I’m a dead man! I don’t
know how in the world I am to go home. Pelagge won’t
believe me, and if she does, I shall never hear the end of
it.... Oh! I’m dead!...”</p>

<p class='c009'>At last they pretended to be convinced, and proposed a
remedy for the misfortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen here,” said Biagio Quaglia; “it must have been
one of the people hereabouts; for it is certain that no one
would have come from India to steal your pig, would they,
Pé?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, of course,” assented Peppe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well then—attend to me now,” continued Ristabilito,
delighted at the devout attention accorded to his words;
“if no one came from India to rob you, it is certain that
one of the people hereabouts must have been the thief;
don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what have we to do? We must get all these
labourers together, and try some charm to discover the
thief. And if we find the thief, we’ve found the pig.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mastro Peppe’s eyes brightened with eagerness, and he
came closer, for the hint at a charm had awakened all his
innate superstition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, you know, there are three kinds of magic—the
black, the red, and the white. And you know there are three
women in the village skilled in the art: Rosa Schiavona,
Rosaria Pajara, and Ciniscia. You have only to choose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Peppe remained a moment in doubt. Then he decided
for Rosaria Pajara, who enjoyed great fame as a sorceress,
and had in past times performed several marvellous feats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” concluded Ristabilito; “there is no time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>be lost. Now, just for your sake, and only to do you a
pleasure, I am going to the town to get everything that will
be wanted. I will talk to Rosaria, get her to give me everything,
and come back before noon. Give me the money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Peppe took three <i><span lang="it">carlini</span></i> from his waistcoat pocket, and
held them out hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three <i><span lang="it">carlini</span></i>?” shouted the other, putting back his
hand. “<em>Three carlini!</em> She’ll want ten at least!”</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing this Pelagge’s husband was almost struck
dumb.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What? Ten <i><span lang="it">carlini</span></i> for a charm?” he stammered, feeling
with trembling fingers in his pocket. “Here are eight
for you. I have no more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well,” said Quaglia dryly; “we’ll see what we
can do. Are you coming along, Ciá?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The two companions set off at a smart pace for Pescara,
along the poplar-bordered path, in Indian file, Ciávola
demonstrating his delight by mighty thumps on Ristabilito’s
back. When they reached the town, they entered the shop
of a certain Don Daniele Pacentro, a chemist of their
acquaintance. Here they purchased certain drugs and
spices, and got him to make them up into little balls the
size of walnuts, which were then well coated with sugar and
baked. Biagio Quaglia (who had disappeared in the meantime)
then returned with a paper full of dirt swept up in the
road, of which he insisted on having two pills made, in
appearance exactly similar to the others, but mixed with
bitter aloes, and only very slightly coated with sugar. The
chemist did as he was desired, putting a mark on the two
bitter pills, at Ristabilito’s suggestion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two jokers now returned to Peppe’s farm, and reached
it about noon. La Bravetta was awaiting them with great
anxiety, and as soon as he saw them shouted, “Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything is in order!” replied Ristabilito triumphantly,
showing the little box of magic confectionery. “Now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>seeing to-day is the Eve of St. Anthony, and the peasants
are taking a holiday, you must call them all together, out
here in the open air, and give them a drink. You have
some casks of Montepulciano; you might as well have some
of that out for once. And when they are all assembled it will
be my business to do and say all that has to be said and done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Two hours later, the afternoon being very warm, bright,
and clear, and La Bravetta having spread the report, all the
farmers of the neighbourhood and their labourers came in
response to the invitation. A great flock of geese went
waddling about among the heaps of straw in the yard; the
smell of the stable came in puffs on the air. They stood
there, quietly laughing and joking with one another, as they
waited for the wine,—these rustics, with their bow-legs, bent
by heavy labour,—some of them with faces wrinkled and
ruddy as old apples, and eyes that had been made gentle
by long patience, or quick with years of cunning; others
young and limber, with beards just coming, and home care
evidenced in their patched and mended clothes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ciávola and Ristabilito did not keep them waiting long.
The latter, holding the box in his hand, directed them to
make a circle round him, and then, standing in the middle,
addressed them in a short oration, not without a certain
gravity of voice and gesture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neighbours,” he began, “none of you, I am sure, knows
the real reason why Mastro Peppe de’ Sieri has summoned
you here....”</p>

<p class='c009'>A movement of astonishment at this strange preamble
passed round the circle, and the joy at the promised wine
gave place to uneasy expectations of various kinds. The
orator continued—</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, as something disagreeable might happen, and you
might afterwards complain of me, I will tell you what it is
all about before we make the experiment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The listeners looked into one another’s eyes with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>bewildered air, and then cast curious and uncertain glances
at the little box which the orator held in his hand. One of
them, as Ristabilito paused to consider the effect of his
words, exclaimed impatiently—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Presently, presently, neighbours. Last night there was
stolen from Mastro Peppe a fine pig which was going to be
salted down. No one knows who the thief is; but it is
quite certain that he will be found among you, because no
one would come from India to steal Mastro Peppe’s pig.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_165.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Whether it was a happy effect of the strange argument
from
India,
or the
action of the
mild winter sun,
La Bravetta began
to sneeze. The rustics
took a step backward, the whole flock of geese scattered in
terror, and seven consecutive sneezes resounded freely in
the air, disturbing the rural stillness of the spot. The noise
restored some cheerfulness to the minds of the assembly,
who in a little while regained their composure, and
Ristabilito continued as gravely as ever—</p>

<p class='c009'>“To find out the thief Mastro Peppe intends to give you
to eat of certain good <i><span lang="it">confetti</span></i>, and to drink of a certain old
Montepulciano, which he has tapped to-day on purpose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>But I must tell you one thing first. The thief, as soon as
he puts the sweets into his mouth, will find them bitter—so
bitter that he will be forced to spit them out. Now, are you
willing to try? Or perhaps the thief, rather than be found
out in this way, would like to go and confess himself to the
priest? Answer, neighbours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are willing to eat and drink,” replied the assembly,
almost with one voice. And a wave of suppressed emotion
passed through all these guileless folk. Each one looked
at his neighbour with a point of interrogation in his eyes;
and each one naturally tried to put a certain ostentatious
spontaneity into his laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Said Ciávola: “You must all stand in a row, so that no
one can hide himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When they were all ready he took the bottle and glasses,
preparing to pour out the wine. Ristabilito went to one
end of the row, and began quietly to distribute the <i><span lang="it">confetti</span></i>,
which crunched and disappeared in a moment under the
splendid teeth of the rustics. When he reached Mastro
Peppe he handed him one of the pills prepared with aloes,
and passed on without giving any sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mastro Peppe, who till then had been standing staring
with his eyes wide open, intent on surprising the culprit, put
the pill into his mouth almost with gluttonous eagerness
and began to chew. Suddenly his cheeks rose with a sudden
movement towards his eyes, the corners of his mouth and
his temples were filled with wrinkles, the skin of his nose
was drawn up into folds, his lower jaw was twisted awry;
all his features formed a pantomimic expression of horror,
and a sort of visible shudder ran down the back of his neck
and over his shoulders. Then, suddenly, since the tongue
could not endure the bitterness of the aloes, and a lump
rising in his throat made it simply impossible for him to
swallow, the miserable man was forced to spit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ohé, Mastro Pé, what are you doing?” exclaimed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>sharp, harsh voice of Tulespre dei Passeri, an old goatherd,
greenish and shaggy as a swamp tortoise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hearing this, Ristabilito, who had not yet finished distributing
the pills, turned suddenly round. Seeing that La
Bravetta was contorting his features and limbs in agony,
he said, with an air of the greatest benevolence—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, perhaps that one was too much done! Here is
another! swallow it, Peppe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And with his finger and thumb he crammed the second
aloe-pill into Peppe’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor man took it, and, feeling the goatherd’s sharp,
malignant eyes fixed on him, made a supreme effort to
overcome his disgust; he neither chewed nor swallowed
the pill, but kept his tongue motionless against his teeth.
But when the aloes began to dissolve, he could bear it no
longer; his lips began to writhe as before, his eyes filled
with tears, which soon overflowed and ran down his cheeks.
At last he had to spit the thing out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ohé, Mastro Pé, and what are you doing <em>now</em>?” cried
the goatherd again, with a grin which showed his toothless,
whitish gums. “Oh! and indeed, now, what does this
mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the peasants broke from their ranks and surrounded
La Bravetta, some with laughing derision, others with angry
words. The sudden and brutal revulsions of pride to which
the sense of honour of the rustic population is subject—the
implacable rigidity of superstition—now suddenly exploded
in a tempest of abuse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did you make us come here for? To try and lay
the blame on us with a false charm? To cheat us? What
for? Thief! liar! son of a dog! etc., etc. Would you
cheat us? You scoundrel! you thief, you! We are going
to break all your pots and dishes! Thief! son of a dog!”
etc., etc., <i><span lang="it">da capo</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having smashed the bottle and glasses, they went their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>ways, shouting back their concluding imprecations from
among the poplars.</p>

<p class='c009'>There remained on the threshing-floor Ciávola, Ristabilito,
the geese, and La Bravetta. The latter, filled with shame,
rage, and confusion, and with his mouth still sore from the
bitterness of the aloes, could not utter a word. Ristabilito,
with a refinement of cruelty, stood looking at him, shaking
his head ironically, and tapping the ground with his foot.
Ciávola crowed, with an indescribable mockery in his
voice—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! ah! ah! ah! Bravo, La Bravetta! Now do tell
us—how much did you make by it? Ten ducats?”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>“It is no use talking, my dear fellow!—there are times
when it is simply impossible to say no. They urge
you—they worry you—they lay you under obligation by so
many kind attentions, that a refusal would be an actual
breach of good manners towards people whose only thought
is to do you a kindness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>You allege business. “Oh!” they reply, “the world will
not come to an end for one day’s absence.” It is too hot?
“Come in the morning, when it is cool.” The village is
such a long way from the station? “We will send the gig
for you.” You have engaged to pass the day with a friend?
“Bring him along with you....” In short, I said yes,—and
so on Sunday morning I went and did the deed.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I had reached the village, and found myself in the
midst of a crowd of peasants coming out from early mass, who
looked at me as if I had been a wild beast, I asked for
Signor Cosimo’s house. Eight or ten people immediately
offered to accompany me thither.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There it is—up there; do you see that house with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>little tower on the top?—that’s it. Do you know Sor
Cosimo? Ah! he’s a good gentleman! And his brother
the priest? And his wife, Sora Flavia? She’s a kind lady,
so she is, and gives away ever so much money. And Sora
Olimpia, too, Signor Cosimo’s sister.... She’s one who
has her own ideas&#160;... as who should say that she has such
a passion for books that she always has one in her hands,
and has nearly lost her head over them; but afterwards, do
you see? she repeats them all by heart, in a way that no
one could believe it! And she is a good creature too;
and, as for her family, when there is anything to be put on
paper, I don’t see how they could ever do without her....
There used to be Bistino, Sor Cosimo’s eldest son, but now
he is in the seminary at Volterra, and they say that he does
them so much credit there that they won’t even let him
come home for the holidays. There’s a boy for you!
When he was at home, and used to help his uncle the
chaplain at his net,<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> the two between them caught more
birds in a day than all the other nets in a week.... Look,
sir, you turn this way and go up hill, and you can’t miss it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>All this varied information about my hosts, with whom
I was already slightly acquainted, was given me on the way
by the peasants, who, each in turn, vied with the rest in
bestowing it on me, till, having escorted me to the end of a
short avenue leading to the villa, they quitted me with
respectful salutations, after asking me whether I required
any servants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely had I rung the bell when the door was opened
by a youth in his shirt sleeves, and a white apron tucked
into the waistband of his trousers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Signor Cosimo in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! yes, sir! Come in, come in! You are that gentleman
from Florence who sent yesterday to say that perhaps
he would come to-day—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, then, come along! The master said I was to
show you into the best room, and he will come presently.
That’s right, sir! You’ve done well to come. Such a long
time as they’ve been talking about you, and expecting
you! Are they all well at Florence? See; come in here
and sit down. Will you excuse me, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on, go on, my good fellow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I went and sat down by the window, and began to turn
over an old photograph album. In the meantime I perceived
that my arrival might truly be said to have created a
sensation, since I could hear on the first floor a great banging
of doors and a going and coming of shod and unshod
feet, which caused a thick shower of whitewash to descend
from the ceiling, and the window-panes and the glass shade
covering a wax figure on the sideboard to vibrate as with an
earthquake.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a few minutes I heard a scratching at the door,
then a kick against it; it opened, and I saw a child of about
six years, with a half-eaten apple in his hand. He looked
at me with an air of displeasure, and asked—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, is that your book? You’ve got to put it down at
once—if you don’t, I’ll tell my uncle the priest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I laid aside the album, but he continued to look daggers
at me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you that stranger that was to come to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, little one.” Affecting a caressing gentleness, in
order to conciliate him, I held out my hand. The small boy
retreated two paces, and showed symptoms of being about
to throw the apple at my head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you keep your hands to yourself? What did you
come up here for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was beginning to feel annoyed, and did not answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes—father told you to come—I know that well
enough; but mother didn’t want you, because she had to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>have all those fowls killed. Gostino is plucking them just
now. But you’re going away this evening?... Won’t
you answer? But I hope you are,—because, when mother
saw you coming along the road, she wished you all sorts of
bad luck.”...</p>

<p class='c009'>The door opened, and there appeared, shod in slippers,
the magnificent bulk of Signor Cosimo, who, smiling
cordially, clapped his great hands on my shoulders, saying,
three times over, “Bravo, bravo, bravo!” Then, turning
to the small boy, he demanded—</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just what I think fit!” replied the infant, who was
thereupon expelled from the room with a tremendous box
on the ear, after which his father turned to me and invited
me to be seated.</p>

<p class='c009'>My eye was at once caught by the grease-spots, and stains
of wine and coffee, which adorned Signor Cosimo’s shirt and
trousers. To tell the truth, I was uncomfortably affected by
the sense of a want of consideration towards myself, but was
soon appeased by his apologies for having kept me waiting,
because he had gone upstairs to his own room, to “clean
himself up a bit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! but.... Don’t mention it, Signor Cosimo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! bravo! bravo! bravo! But what a season, eh?
Look here, you must be in need of some refreshment....
Gostino-o-o-o! What are they saying? What do they say
in Florence about the crops?... Bravo! bravo! It is
very good of you to have come; you have given us a
regular treat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you call, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go upstairs, Gostino, and ask your mistress to give you
the keys of the sideboard, and bring this gentleman some
refreshments.” Then to the child, who had returned in the
wake of the servitor, “Go at once and get your face washed
and make yourself fit to be seen.” With that, he boxed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>small boy’s ears a second time, and turned him out of the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And as to fruit, my dear sir, there’s nothing at all this
year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what is one to say? For the last three years it’s
clear there has been witchcraft in it. Just imagine it. I
used to put aside four hundred pounds in a year, and
now&#160;... sometimes fifty, sometimes sixty.... And then,
what stuff it is! Every bit worm-eaten! I beg your pardon,
but will you come down into the granary with me?
But, no—I hear my brother coming down; we’ll wait for
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us wait for him, by all means.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s a queer sort of customer, you know—a confirmed
grumbler!—but, after all, a good sort at bottom. The
other day, for instance, do you see——he suffers so much
from——”</p>

<p class='c009'>These preliminaries to the introduction were interrupted
by the appearance of Don Paolo himself, who entered the
room with a profound bow. I rose, and was going to meet
him, but he protested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, I won’t have it—don’t disturb yourself, sir. If
you will excuse me, I will keep my hat on, as that is my
custom. Sit down, sit down, pray.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a moment of silence, and then Sor Cosimo
resumed the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, Paolo, this is the gentleman whom we were
speaking of——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know! I know! Bless you! can’t you make an end
of it? How many times do you find it necessary to repeat
a thing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—I wanted to tell you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you sent for refreshments?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told Gostino. He is just coming.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“And so you’re from Florence, eh?” asked the chaplain,
turning to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At your service.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A wretched year, my dear sir! If it does not rain
soon we shall never get any crops to speak of.... A year
ago this very day I had taken fifty-six birds by ten o’clock;
and this morning, before I came away to mass at eight, we
had caught three miserable little things, and an accursed
hawk that has half bitten my hand to pieces—look! Are
they taking any at Florence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To tell the truth, I have never asked.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the Prior of San Gaggio catching any this year?—is
he catching any?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To my knowledge&#160;... I could not say at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! because last Friday he sent to tell me that he had
not even had the decoy-cages made. He says that Father
Lorenzo della Santissima Annunziata is not well. Is that
true?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To tell the truth&#160;... I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!—do you know nothing, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell you.... Let us rather speak of yourself.
Signor Cosimo was telling me just now——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must run out for a moment to the net. I say, Cosimo,
what time is dinner?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell the women to get it at any hour that suits you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! here’s one of them,” said Don Paolo, who was
just in the doorway. “What o’clock do we dine, Flavia?—at
twelve?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Signora Flavia, the wife of my host, bowed her head in
assent as she entered the room, while the chaplain, an
unsaluted guest, went off to his nets. She came to meet me,
asked me how I was, said that she was pleased to hear it
before I had time to answer “Well,” and planted herself in
a chair to look at me. Sor Cosimo, upon Whom all the
conversation seemed to devolve, remarked—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“See, Flavia, this is the gentleman who, as I was telling
you the other evening——” Whereupon Sora Flavia began
again, <i><span lang="it">da capo</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How are you?—Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your wife?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember me to her.” Then, looking at her husband
as if to ask him whether she ought to say any more to me,
she relapsed into silence, and fell to contemplating me again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately Signor Cosimo relieved me from the embarrassment
of choosing the subject of conversation by reverting
to politics. The Tunis Question being then at its height,
he naturally fell upon it tooth and nail, grew heated and
excited, and blurted out, puffing and blowing, all his ideas
touching foreign politics, concluding with the statement that
if he and his brother the priest had been in the Cabinet,
there would not be a Frenchman in Tunis.... At this
point Signora Flavia interrupted him by asking me if there
was any cotton in the material of my coat. I choked down
a burst of laughter, and hazarded the answer that there was
not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it is very dear, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I think it was seven francs a mètre.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! they measure by mètres, do they? It must be
good stuff, though. Just look, Cosimo; you ought to have
one made like it——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes; just like you—always interrupting! We’ll
speak of that afterwards.”... Then, turning to me
again—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because, if France——” He was just about to
recommence the attack on Tunis when the door opened
to admit his sister Olimpia, a maiden lady of fifty or so,
the same whose literary reputation had made so great an
impression on the peasants.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>She had on a faded light blue dress, wore a crinoline,
and carried a puce-coloured mantilla over her arm. On
her head she had a broad-brimmed straw hat of a dingy
yellow, adorned with a wreath of real ivy, and two small
locks of well-greased hair fell in soft folds on the slightly
roughened skin of her cheeks. In one hand she carried
her parasol and a bunch of lavender; in the other a book,
in which she kept her finger to mark the place. She
advanced with ostentatious ease of manner, and bowed,
half-shutting her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir,” she said, “you are welcome to this modest habitation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A delicious habitation, Signorina, where I should be
very sorry to be troublesome.” She again half-shut her eyes,
and smiled on me. Retiring backwards, as gracefully as
she could, she went and sat down with her back to the
window. She was evidently well acquainted with the
clumsy artifices of a very mature young lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was contemplating her with the utmost attention, when
I felt a heavy hand on my shoulder, and Sor Cosimo said
to me—</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought to hear what poetry this girl writes! Have
you got it here, Olimpia—that sonnet you made last
Sunday?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That ode, you mean—come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well—sonnet or ode—it’s the same thing. But if
you could hear it—with rhymes, and all! I tell you!
Come, let us hear it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Afterwards, Cosimo, afterwards!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Heaven preserve me! Turning to Signorina Olimpia,
who still kept her finger in her book, I asked—</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you reading, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am just glancing over Leopardi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! ah!” And Sor Cosimo broke in—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine! fine!—ah! very fine!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Are you acquainted with his works, Sor Cosimo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! most certainly! She read it to us last Sunday at
dessert, and made us all cry like babies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Cosimo, you do not understand. The gentleman
means this book that I have here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! what! Well, well!... I was speaking of the
sonnet. But you shall hear it afterwards.... And you
must repeat that one too that you wrote when Calamai’s son
was made a priest. Oh! <em>that!</em> And then.... But don’t
imagine, sir, that she has only one. She has a whole
drawer full, and you may say that, if one is fine, others are
not so bad.... Well, you shall hear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was eager to hear her opinion of Leopardi, and asked—</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think of this book, Signorina?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell you,” she replied. “To say the truth, I have
scarcely got at the bottom of it as yet,&#160;... but, if I must
speak sincerely, it seems to me there is not much interest
in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you think so too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—yes—in a manner of speaking, yes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you will allow me to say so, no story is ever finished
properly. You find Consalvo—that, now, is stolen from
Tasso, the scene of Clorinda and Tancred.... Well, you
find Consalvo. What then? Consalvo dies, and, at least
as far as I have got, one hears no more of her. And the
same thing with the characters. There is that one of that
Nerina; it would be fine enough, but, good heavens! it is
so little developed&#160;... and one does not know what to
make of it...! Do you agree with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well&#160;... to tell the truth&#160;...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, Cosimo, whether or not I was right when we
were discussing the subject the other evening with Signora
Amalia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think so, indeed!” exclaimed Sor Cosimo,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>testifying his approval by a great guffaw of laughter. “Do
you mean to say you would compare yourself with that conceited
creature? Let her go for seven years to school with
the Sisters of St. Francis de Sales, as you have been, and then
come and talk to us....”</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>The amazing literary criticisms of Sor Cosimo and his
sister completely took away my breath. I was relieved from
the necessity of answering by the appearance of Gostino
with a bottle and a tray of glasses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure you’ll like this wine, sir; you’ll see!” said
Gostino as he poured me out some wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come, Gostino!” said Signorina Olimpia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look sharp, Gostino,” continued Sor Cosimo; “go and
fetch two more bottles—one of ’62 (you’ll find it on the
table at the end of the cellar), and the other of ’59 (the year
of the Revolution), and you shall see”—he turned to me
again—“you shall see you have never tasted any like
this!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But&#160;... that’s enough, Signor Cosimo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come; no compliments. While it’s coming
you’ll take another drop of this, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks, but I could not.... I am not accustomed....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir—I’m going to have another glass too—as the friar
took a wife, for company’s sake.... Shall I pour you
some out? You can throw it away afterwards, if you
like—but I must pour if out”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then; since you wish it so, another sip....
Enough,—that’s enough!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir—the glass full, or none!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gostino returned with the other bottles, and then they
all fell upon me, beginning with Signora Flavia, and not
excluding Gostino, beseeching me to try those also. Signor
Cosimo nudged my elbow, Gostino poured out the wine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>and the two ladies entreated me with eloquent glances not
to do them the wrong of refusing this attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>I resisted for a little, but had to give way at last; and
then my evil genius inspired me with the notion of praising
the quality of the wine, and remarking that not only must
the grapes have been exquisite, but the casks and cellars
first-rate also. I regretted the words the moment they were
out of my mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to show you them,” said Sor Cosimo
immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took my arm, and, leaving the ladies in the dining-room,
dragged me off to the cellar, with Gostino to
light the way—now warning me of a step, and again
requesting me to stoop where the ceiling was low, and at
last showing himself more astonished than I could possibly
be at the beauty of a cobwebbed vault, with a few casks
along one wall, and two smaller barrels in a corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>As it was necessary for me to be astonished, and to admire
something, I began to praise the solid construction of the
house, which I inferred from an inspection of the basement
walls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you shall see it now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>From the cellar we ascended to the ground floor, which I
had to review in detail—dining-room, ironing-room, kitchen,
oven, larder, cupboards.... Then the new staircase—the
first one was where the store-room is now.... Then the
study, which his brother the priest had wished to have on
the site of the stable they had had pulled down, but that
was too damp.... Then up to the first floor—drawing-room,
sitting-rooms, bed-rooms, and everything,—in fact,
before I knew what I was about, I beheld Sora Olimpia
trying on her puce-coloured mantle before the looking-glass....
“Look out of the window—now isn’t that a view?
There’s the kitchen-garden. We’ll go there afterwards, but
first you must see the second floor.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>We went up to the second floor, where he led me round
for some twenty minutes, explaining in detail the destination
of every apartment, together with the most noteworthy
events which had taken place in the same—from the large
room where the silkworms lived to the dark den where the
chaplain kept the bullfinches he was teaching to pipe....</p>

<p class='c009'>At the foot of the stairs we met Don Paolo returning
from his quail nets, puffing and blowing, and grumbling at
the Provost’s hurry to get to church. “Was he afraid of
not finishing mass in time to get back to dinner, the great
glutton? Do, for any sake, go on, Cosimo; do me the kindness—bad
luck to this sort of work!—and tell them to be getting
ready in the meantime, and I’ll come in ten minutes—if
they don’t like that, they may sing mass by themselves....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you see?” whispered Sor Cosimo to me, “that’s his
way. If he doesn’t catch any birds he becomes a regular
beast. Come, let us go on; the ladies will follow by themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They have already started, sir,” said Gostino.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All the better; come along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I should have been thankful to sit down and rest for a
minute, but had to follow Sor Cosimo, who, in order to get
away from his brother, set off at such a pace that it was
difficult to keep up with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mountains stand firm, and men move on. When Sor
Cosimo, hurrying into the door of the canon’s house, left me
under the church-porch, my eye fell on a well-dressed man
whose face somehow seemed familiar. As we passed each
other, in walking up and down, I saw that his eyes were
fixed on me, and that he was smiling, as if about to address me.
I was just about to speak to him, as we met for the third
time, when he uttered my name, and I suddenly recalled his.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After nineteen years! How in the world did you get
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“I’m the parish doctor. And you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I only came out for the day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll come and dine with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am engaged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To whom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll speak of that afterwards. Now tell me about
yourself.... How are you getting on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As well as a country doctor ever does.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And with the peasants.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Badly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because, being a gentleman, I am not a beast like
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand. And how about the local authorities?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No better. I am not on good terms with the Syndic;
and, by-the-bye, I must be off before he comes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The reason?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was imprudent enough to contradict him in public—in
the chemist’s shop, when, speaking of books on
etiquette, he mentioned Monsignor della Casa and <em>Flavio</em>
Gioja!”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is this portent of erudition?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wealthiest, the most cultured, the most respectable
person in the commune—a certain Signor Cosimo.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My host!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you staying at his house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How in the world—— But never mind now,—after
dinner you must come to me and tell me about everything,
and we shall be together till you leave. I have a great deal
to talk to you about—I’ll drive you down to the station....
Now let us go in.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Here you see my masters,” he said, with a smile, as we
came to a halt in a corner at the upper end of the church.
“They are all up there. Do you know any of them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only Signor Cosimo’s family.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you the names of some—they are quite worth
your attention. They wouldn’t be bad sort of people if it
were not for the intolerable airs they give themselves on the
strength of their ignorance. All well known, though!—all
honest folks,—and all of them very much admired, because
the rest of the parish are greater asses than they. Do you
see the priest who is celebrating? That is the Provost of
Siepole. A profound theologian—a thriving dealer in oil—confessor
to the nunnery—a great eater.... He doesn’t
like me, but he puts up with me ever since I cured him of
an indigestion which he brought on by eating salted cheese
and beans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s not young,” I observed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Over sixty. The one at his right is his chaplain, who is
at daggers drawn with me, and gives it out all over the
country that I am a lunatic, because I once refused to make
him out a false certificate of illness. I think there is not
much love lost between the two, for family reasons.... And
yet they are never apart; the chaplain’s chief occupation is
to water down his superior’s oaths. Every time the Provost
takes a trick at cards he says ‘<i><span lang="it">Giuraddio</span></i>,’ and the chaplain
qualifies it with ‘<i><span lang="it">Bacco</span></i>.’ So they go on, for the sake of
saving appearances and their souls; but sometimes the
Provost feels it as an insult to his dignity, and takes it ill,
and then he snubs the chaplain, and in his wrath the oaths
come dropping out like the beads off a broken rosary, while
the chaplain goes on counteracting them with his ‘<i><span lang="it">Bacco!
bacco!</span></i>’ quite unmoved, and ready to face martyrdom rather
than yield. He is the best shot about here, and could beat
the whole village at <i><span lang="it">briscola</span></i>. The poor people adore him,
because he says mass in ten minutes, is easy at confession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and has no scruples about thrashing any man that tries to
play tricks on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The little thin man on this side is an unattached priest—a
good fellow—miserably poor, and in wretched health.
He contrives to worry along somehow and support an elder
sister and two grand-children of hers, whom he teaches
himself. He is master, father, and uncle to them, all in
one; and ekes out his means by the help of four or five
other pupils, whom he picks up wherever he can at a franc
a month. No one knows how he does it, but he pays his
way, and keeps an honoured name as a good citizen and
blameless priest; and, above all, he is such a <i><span lang="it">rara avis</span></i> as
not to call down the curse of heaven on his country.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a>...
In the village, as you may easily understand, people either
don’t trouble their heads about him, or else they despise him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That other is Sor Cosimo’s brother, whom you know....
I’ll tell you something about him too; but hush!...
every one is kneeling down....”</p>

<p class='c008'>The silence was followed by the usual shuffling of feet,
tinkling of medals, and indispensable volley of previously
suppressed coughs. The air was becoming more and more
unendurably close. The doctor recommenced his remarks
in an undertone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Sor Cosimo’s brother&#160;... he is nicknamed
‘Thickskull’, and yet...” Here he leaned over and
whispered in my ear....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” I exclaimed in astonishment. “Every day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On my word of honour!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Sor Cosimo smiled at me from the other side of the
church, and waved his hand at the organ, as if to say,
“What an instrument we have, and what an organist!
You hear—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“That man beside Sor Cosimo, with the great black silk
scarf round his neck,” my friend went on, “is Stelloni
the miller, a member of the School Board. Sor Cosimo
nominated him, because—considering the antipathy which
Stelloni has shown towards all schools from his childhood
up—he was able to assure the Council that he would never
be one to advocate <em>unnecessary</em> expense! In fact, Stelloni,
true to his principles, has never set foot inside a schoolhouse.
He says it is from a desire not to compromise
himself, knowing, as he does, that things are not managed
in the way he would approve of; low and unmannerly
people say it is because he is afraid of having to question
the children. He’s a good-natured sort of fellow, though,
and hates no one in the world except the schoolmaster—that
pale young man standing over there by the pillar,—because
he once corrected a grammatical mistake in a
composition by the miller’s son. Stelloni felt a kindly
compassion for the master as long as the point remained
doubtful; but when it was established beyond question
that the master was right, his compassion turned to implacable
hatred, and now he would be glad of any excuse for
turning him out into the road to starve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That little thin old man, at the end of the row on the
right, is one of the richest landowners in the place; a
retired lawyer, and Sor Cosimo’s predecessor as Syndic.
His ruling passion is that of running his head against stone
walls, and systematically contradicting, at every meeting of
the Council, everything that Sor Cosimo proposes. He has
immortalised himself by means of two inscriptions which he
had put up—with his own name in capital letters—during
his term of office: one on the public well, when he had the
pump put up,—the other you see opposite you—when he
had the ciborium in the Chapel of the Seven Sorrows re-gilt
at his own expense. He got himself elected Syndic in order
to get the new government road run past the gates of his villa.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Afterwards, when he found this impossible, and also failed
to get the title of ‘Cavaliere,’ he retired in a rage. Now
he relieves his feelings by taking the opposition side in
the Council;—he turns off one tenant every year, and
imprecates the wrath of Providence on the Government
at every possible opportunity—even when the frost ruined
his early tomatoes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you are in the hands of these people?” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am in the hands of these people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>... At the moment of going to table, Sor Cosimo
said to me, with a wink, “We must keep up our spirits
to-day—bravo! bravo!” Signora Flavia repeated, for the
sixth time, her fear that I should find it penitential fare at
best, seeing that they had made no alteration in their
usual Sunday’s dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good heavens!” I exclaimed, ostensibly because I
was hurt by these apologies, but in reality because I felt I
could not stand much more. Signorina Olimpia preceded
us, curtseying backwards, after having presented me with a
roguish glance and a little bunch of jessamine; and we
entered the dining-room, prepared for a great occasion, as
was evident from the odorous presence of table-linen fresh
from the quinces and lavender of the store-closet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are,” Sor Cosimo began again. “We have no
ceremony here—a little soup, a bit of boiled meat, a
sweet thing or two, and that’s all!” He crossed himself
and said grace.</p>

<p class='c009'>The small boy whose acquaintance I had made in the
morning, had, on entering the room, remained open-mouthed
for a time; but when he had taken in all the
preparations, and more especially a side-table covered with
pastry, sweets and bottles, he could control himself no
longer, and turning to me, yelled, bringing down both his
fists on the table—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Oh! I say, this is jolly! Look what a lot of nice things
there are to-day, because you’re here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sor Cosimo aimed a kick at him under the table, which
fortunately missed its mark; and immediately a frozen
silence fell upon the guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>The women sighed,—the men glared upon that boy with
looks which ought to have reduced him to ashes on the
spot,—and I turned to Signor Cosimo and asked him,
with an air of innocent bewilderment, what his son had said.
My stratagem was perfectly successful, and every one’s face
had brightened up when Gostino appeared in his shirt sleeves,
bringing in the soup. Signora Flavia called him to her, and
whispered something in his ear. At the next course Gostino
returned in his shooting-jacket, and with his hat on. Signora
Flavia called him again; and when he next appeared, with the
boiled meat, he had left his hat behind, and cast a questioning
glance at his mistress, as much as to say, “Is it right
now?” She nodded an affirmative, but Sor Cosimo signified
to him, by another glance, that he ought to have known
these things without being told. Gostino signified, in
reply, by a shrug of his shoulders, that they had been
bothering him unnecessarily, and requested me to take
another piece of chicken.</p>

<p class='c009'>This politeness on Gostino’s part was the signal for attack.
The wine had begun to revive the spirits of the company,
and had affected Sor Cosimo more than the rest. A tenant
came in to say that at Don Paolo’s net in the garden they
had taken seven bullfinches, by which means he too was
cheered up; and now I found myself overwhelmed by the
avalanche of attentions these good people bestowed on me.
They heaped my plate with eatables, and pressed on me one
dish after another, new ones appearing every time I
imagined dinner was at an end. I must take some spinach,
because it was a rarity at this time of year; I must taste that
other dish, because Signorina Olimpia had made the sauce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>herself. And all the time Gostino was behind my chair,
reproaching me for eating nothing, and Signora Flavia was
lamenting that the dinner was not to my taste....</p>

<p class='c009'>At last it was at an end....</p>

<p class='c009'>And the conversation during dinner? There was none!
There was a continual, dull succession of “Take some——”—“Thank
you”—“You’re not eating”—“You’re not
drinking”—and of roars of laughter whenever they had hit
upon a new device for cramming me to death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The poems, Olimpia, the poems!” yelled Signor
Cosimo at last. “The sonnet for Calamai!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I turned at once to Signorina Olimpia, to read in her eyes
the gravity of the calamity which threatened me, and I saw
there an expression which made me sorry for her. Signora
Flavia had the same look, and even in the face of that irrepressible
child I thought I read something like fear. They
all gazed at Sor Cosimo in a piteously questioning manner,
and then simultaneously turned towards the place at the end
of the table, at his right.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that point the master of the house called Gostino, in
a tone of vexation, and the latter appeared, in company with
two tenants, who, seizing Don Paolo under the arms, dragged
him like a log out of the room. I jumped up to offer my
assistance, but Sor Cosimo stopped me, telling me, with a
look of mingled pain and humiliation, that I was not to be
frightened—it was quite a customary thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In an hour or two he’ll be all right—heart complaint.
The attacks come on when he has over-eaten himself a
little....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why does he not try to moderate himself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sor Cosimo shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does it often happen?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every day, poor uncle!” replied Signorina Olimpia.
“Ah! it is indeed a great inconvenience!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what does the doctor say?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Ah!” exclaimed Sor Cosimo. “Precisely!—you know
him, that—that——” He had no epithet wherewith to
qualify the doctor. “The doctor laughs.... I’ll tell you
what he says—he laughs; and when I sent for him the
second time, after one of these attacks,&#160;... and when it
was I who had got him his appointment, you understand?
<em>I</em> got it for him! Well, he had the audacity to say to
that poor fellow, ‘Chaplain, if I were you, I’d put a little
water in it next time!’ There, do you understand now
what the doctor says? But he has never set foot in my
house since, and I hope.... Where are you going to give
us coffee, Flavia, here, or in the garden?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The matter being referred to me, I voted at once for the
garden, eager to get a mouthful of fresh air, and all the
more as it was a lovely day.... There was a ring at the
gate bell, and Gostino having opened, I saw five persons
advancing up the avenue—three priests and two laymen, all
red in the face as turkey-cocks, and talking at the very top
of their voices. Sor Cosimo took me by the arm, and
drawing me forward, introduced me to the Provost of
Siepole and his chaplain, then to the parish priest of the
village, and lastly to the assessor Stelloni and the communal
secretary.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>The talk went on, chiefly on personal and local topics,
beginning with the small-pox, which, according to Stelloni,
was being “promulgated” in the neighbouring villages, and
ending with Sor Cosimo’s fountain, which he regretted he
could not turn on for our edification, as Don Paolo kept the
key of the mechanism in his own chest of drawers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Signora Flavia looked at us absently, with sleepy eyes,
which she opened wide every time she heard an extra loud
clatter of crockery from the kitchen, where Gostino was
washing up. Signorina Olimpia, perhaps disgusted with a
conversation which was unworthy of her, was wandering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>round the garden, casting loving looks at her flowers, till
at last, stopping before a monthly rose with two bees on it,
she exclaimed: “Dear insects,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sucking, for one brief moment,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now this, now the other flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! she said——”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Always a poetess, Signorina Olimpia!” cried the Provost,
“always a poetess! Are those your own verses,
madam, are they yours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come now, Olimpia, out with it, before it is too late,”
urged Sor Cosimo. “The sonnet to Calamai—we must
have that at once, for it’s a beauty!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a wonder!” observed the Provost. “Do you know,
I have it by heart; I could say it off, as though it were before
me in print. It is the only one of yours I have heard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rejoice, O youthful boy...”</p>

<p class='c009'>Signorina Olimpia was preparing to repeat the much-desired
sonnet when Don Paolo appeared in the doorway of the
house, looking as though he had gone to sleep in his clothes
and were just out of bed, and stopped on the threshold,
looking fixedly on the ground. They all went up to him,
to congratulate him and ask how he felt....</p>

<p class='c009'>“The heart, gentlemen! the heart!” He put both
hands to the left side of his chest, half closing his eyes and
twisting his mouth, as if to indicate a spasm which was
taking away his breath. Then he asked—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have they done anything more at the nets, Cosimo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Five more, Don Paolo!” shouted Gostino from the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Five! Then we’ve made it fifteen to-day!” cried Don
Paolo, reviving as if by magic. “Gostino, my hat and stick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sor Cosimo cast a glance at us to signify that we ought to
go to the nets as well, and that this attention would be extremely
grateful to his brother. The clergy, however, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>brave enough to refuse, alleging that it would soon be time
for vespers. The remaining four of us started—Sor Cosimo,
the Secretary, Stelloni, and myself—to the great delight of
Don Paolo, who led the way with somewhat uncertain steps,
telling me that he had reserved a fine cock bullfinch for the
Prior of San Gaggio, and hoped I would do him the favour
of taking it to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now three, and the train left at six. I made
various attempts to get away and keep my engagement
with my old friend, but no excuse would serve. To say
that I had an appointment with the doctor after what I had
heard would have been like dealing my hosts a slap in the
face, and every stratagem which I devised was vain. I said
I wanted to go into the village for cigars, as I had none
left; Stelloni offered me half of his. I said I wished to
write a post-card; the Secretary informed me I should find
the post-office closed, and Sor Cosimo added that he would
give me one, and I should write it when we returned from
the nets, so that there was nothing for it but to give in.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had to hurry back, as no one would have dreamed of
beginning vespers without Sor Cosimo and Stelloni in the
choir. The ladies had a new set of refreshments ready for
us when we reached the house; Gostino came to ask when
the horse would be wanted, and we set off for the church at
increased speed.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>Returning from church, I saw the doctor in the distance.
He signed to me that he hoped we should meet at Florence,
and I went on, feeling like a traitor going to execution, who
sees his friends in the crowd and cannot speak to or take
leave of them....</p>

<p class='c009'>Gostino had already harnessed the horse, and seeing this
I uttered a sigh of satisfaction. Truly, I was in a pitiable
state. I could scarcely stand, tired out with the dawdling
but continued motion of the whole day; my digestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>was upset, for obvious reasons; my head was on fire, and
heavy as lead.... Oh, for my own house! But the sigh
was abruptly cut short when, just as I was settling myself
in the gig, Signora Flavia came calmly up and began to say,
while the rest of the household stood motionless to listen—</p>

<p class='c009'>“See now, as you are so obliging, would you do us a
kindness? I have written out all the things, so that
you will not forget anything.” And she read out, by the
twilight—</p>

<p class='c009'>“1. <em>To take Sora Amalia’s spectacles to that spectacle-maker
at the Canto Alla Paglia</em>, and have the broken glass mended.
Gostino has them in his pocket, and will give them to you
at the station.</p>

<p class='c009'>“2. Five mètres, or else seven yards, just as you think
best, of stuff like that of your coat; to be sent on Thursday
by the carrier——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you written down the bird-seed, Flavia?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have put down everything. Now be quiet&#160;... by
the carrier who puts up just outside the Porta San Frediano,
where there is a board with ‘Stabling and coach-house.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And about the wine?” asked Sor Cosimo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here it is. To tell Scatizzi, the wine-seller in Borgognissanti—of
course you know him—that if he wants another
cartload of the same wine, now is the time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you’ve forgotten the bird-seed and the bullfinch,
after all!” said Don Paolo impatiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here—now comes your turn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“4. Three pounds of bird-seed from the man in the little
alley which runs from the Via Calzaioli into the Ghetto.
Have you put the measure into the box, Gostino?”—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am; but please make haste, or we shall be
late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“5. A bullfinch to be taken to the Prior of San Gaggio.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you taken it, Gostino?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Master Paolo. He’s tied under the gig.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“And you’ll remember me to him?” said Don Paolo,
“and tell him that I caught fifteen to-day, and he is to send
and tell me how his nets are doing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And here,” said Signora Flavia, pointing to a huge
bundle tied up at the back of the gig, “I have put together a
little country green-stuff for you, as you said you liked it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I&#160;... really&#160;... Thank you, Signora Flavia,
many thanks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And this,” said Signorina Olimpia, approaching, “will
you keep this in remembrance of me?” She handed me a
sheet of paper folded in four, shook my hand three times
over, and wished me a pleasant journey.... The farewells
were said, and we were off....</p>

<p class='c009'>When we had left the village behind us I cast my eye
over Signorina Olimpia’s souvenir, and relieved my feelings
by one of those hearty laughs which make one feel like a new
creature. It was an autograph copy of the sonnet on the
ordination of Calamai’s son.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>“The forty-seventh proposition!” said Professor Roveni,
in a tone of mild sarcasm, as he unfolded a paper
which I had extracted, very gingerly, from an urn standing
on his desk. Then he showed it to the Government
Inspector who stood beside him, and whispered something
into his ear. Finally, he handed me the document, so that
I might read the question with my own eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go up to the blackboard,” added the Professor, rubbing
his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The candidate who had preceded me in the arduous
trial, and had got out of it as best he could, had left the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>school-room on tiptoe, and, in opening the door, let in a
long streak of sunshine, which flickered on wall and floor,
and in which I had the satisfaction of seeing my shadow.
The door closed again, and the room was once more plunged
into twilight. It was a stifling day in August, and the
great sun-blinds of blue canvas were a feeble defence against
the glass, so that the Venetian shutters had been closed as
well. The little light which remained was concentrated on
the master’s desk and the blackboard, and was, at any rate,
sufficient to illuminate my defeat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go to the blackboard and draw the figure,” repeated
Professor Roveni, perceiving my hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tracing the figure was the only thing I knew how to do;
so I took a piece of chalk and conscientiously went to work.
I was in no hurry; the more time I took up in this graphic
part, the less remained for oral explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Professor was not the man to lend himself to my
innocent artifice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make haste,” he said. “You are not going to draw one
of Raphael’s Madonnas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I had to come to an end.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Put the letters now. Quick!—you are not giving
specimens of handwriting. Why did you erase that G?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because it is too much like the C I have made already.
I was going to put an H instead of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a subtle idea!” observed Roveni, with his usual
irony. “Have you finished?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” said I; adding under my breath, “More’s the
pity!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come,—why are you standing there moonstruck?
Enunciate the theorem!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then began my sorrows. The terms of the question had
escaped my memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a triangle&#160;...” I stammered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I took courage and said all I knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a triangle&#160;... the square of the hypothenuse is
equal to the squares of the other two sides.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In any triangle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no!” suggested a compassionate soul behind me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir!” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Explain yourself. In what sort of a triangle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A right-angled triangle,” whispered the prompting voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A right-angled triangle,” I repeated, like a parrot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silence there, behind!” shouted the Professor; and then
continued, turning to me, “Then, according to you, the
big square is equal to each of the smaller ones?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Good gracious! the thing was absurd. But I had a
happy inspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir, to both of them added together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the sum then,—say to the sum. And you should
say <em>equivalent</em>, not equal. Now demonstrate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was in a cold perspiration—icy cold—despite the
tropical temperature. I looked stupidly at the right-angled
triangle, the square of the hypothenuse, and its two subsidiary
squares; I passed the chalk from one hand to the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>and back again, and said nothing, for the very good reason
that I had nothing to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one prompted me any more. It was so still you
might have heard a pin drop. The Professor fixed his grey
eyes on me, bright with a malignant joy; the Government
Inspector was making notes on a piece of paper. Suddenly
the latter respectable personage cleared his throat, and
Professor Roveni said in his most insinuating manner,
“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Instead of at once sending me about my business, the
Professor wished to imitate the cat which plays with the
mouse before tearing it to pieces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?” he added. “Perhaps you are seeking a new
solution. I do not say that such may not be found, but we
shall be quite satisfied with one of the old ones. Go on.
Have you forgotten that you ought to produce the two
sides, DE, MF, till they meet? Produce them—go on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I obeyed mechanically. The figure seemed to attain a
gigantic size, and weighed on my chest like a block of
stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put a letter at the point where they meet—an N. So.
And now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I remained silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you think it necessary to draw a line down from
N through A to the base of the square, BHIC?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought nothing of the kind; however, I obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you will have to produce the two sides, BH and
IC.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ouf! I could endure no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” the Professor went on, “a child of two could do
the demonstration. Have you nothing to observe with
reference to the two triangles, BAC and NAE?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As silence only prolonged my torture, I replied laconically,
“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“In other words, you know nothing at all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you ought to have seen that some time ago,” I
replied, with a calm worthy of Socrates.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, very good! Is that the tone you take?
And don’t you even know that the theorem of Pythagoras
is also called the Asses’ Bridge, because it is just the asses
who cannot get past it? You can go. I hope you understand
that you have not passed in this examination. That
will teach you to read <cite>Don Quixote</cite> and draw cats during
my lessons!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Government Inspector took a pinch of snuff; I laid
down the chalk and the duster, and walked majestically out
of the hall, amid the stifled laughter of my school-fellows.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three or four comrades who had already passed through
the ordeal with no very brilliant result were waiting for me
outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ploughed, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ploughed!” I replied, throwing myself into an attitude
of heroic defiance; adding presently, “I always said that
mathematics were only made for dunces.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course!” exclaimed one of my rivals.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What question did you have?” asked another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The forty-seventh proposition. What can it matter
to me whether the square of the hypothenuse is or is not
equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it can’t matter to you—nor to me—nor to
any one in the world,” chimed in a third with all the
petulant ignorance of fourteen. “If it is equal, why do
they want to have it repeated so often? and if it is not,
why do they bother us with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Believe me, you fellows,” said I, resuming the discussion
with the air of a person of long experience, “you may be
quite certain of it, the whole system of instruction is wrong;
and as long as the Germans are in the country, it will
be so!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>So, being fully persuaded that our failure was a protest
against the Austrian dominion, and a proof of vivid and
original genius, we went home, where, for my part, I confess
I found that the first enthusiasm soon evaporated.</p>

<p class='c009'>My ignominious failure in this examination had a great
influence on my future. Since it was absolutely impossible
for me to understand mathematics, it was decided that very
day that I was to leave school, especially as the family
finances made it necessary for me to begin earning something
as soon as might be.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the most sensible resolution that could have been
come to, and I had no right to oppose it; yet, I confess, I
was deeply saddened by it. My aversion to mathematics
did not extend to other branches of learning, in which
I had made quite a respectable show; and besides, I loved
the school. I loved those sacred cloisters which we boys
filled with life and noise,—I loved the benches carved with
our names,—even the blackboard which had been the
witness of my irreparable defeat.</p>

<p class='c009'>I blamed Pythagoras’ theorem for it all. With some other
question—who knows?—I might just have scraped through,
by the skin of my teeth, as I had done in past years. But,
as Fate would have it, it was just that one!</p>

<p class='c009'>I dreamt about it all night. I saw it before me—the
fatal square with its triangle atop, and the two smaller
squares, one sloping to the right, and the other to the left,
and a tangle of lines, and a great confusion of letters; and
heard beating through my head like the strokes of a
hammer—BAC = NAF; RNAB = DEAB.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was some time before I was free from that nightmare
and could forget Pythagoras and his three squares. In the
long run, however, Time, who with his sponge wipes out so
many things from the book of memory, had nearly effaced
this; when, a few weeks ago, the ill-omened figure appeared
to me in one of my son’s exercise-books.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Has this curse been transmitted to my descendants?”
I exclaimed. “Poor boy! What if the theorem of
Pythagoras should be as fatal to him as it has been to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought I would question him about it on his return
from school.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So,” I began gravely, “you have already reached the
forty-seventh proposition of Euclid in your geometry?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_197.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, father,” he replied simply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A difficult theorem,” I added, shaking my head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think so?” he asked with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you want to boast and make me think you find it
easy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I do find it easy.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“I should like to see you try it”—the words slipped out
almost involuntarily. “It’s no use—I can’t bear vanity
and boasting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At once,” replied the dauntless youth. And action
succeeded words. He took a piece of paper and a pencil,
and quickly traced the cabalistic figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As for demonstrations,” he began, “there are plenty to
choose from. Is it all the same to you which I take?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” I replied mechanically. In fact it <em>had</em> to be all
the same to me. If there had been a hundred demonstrations
I should not have known one from the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we’ll take the most usual one,” my mathematician
went on; and proceeded to produce the lines which Professor
Roveni, of respected memory, had made me produce twenty-seven
years before, and, with the accents of the sincerest
conviction, prepared to prove to me that the triangle BAC
was equal to the triangle NAF, and so on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now,” said my son, when he had finished, “we can,
if you wish, arrive at the same conclusion in another way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For pity’s sake!” I exclaimed in terror, “since we
have reached the journey’s end, let us rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am not tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not even tired! Was the boy an embryo Newton? And
yet people talk about the principle of heredity!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you are at the top of your class in mathematics,”
I said, not untouched by a certain reverential awe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no,” he replied. “There are two better than I.
Besides, you know very well that everybody—except downright
asses—understands the forty-seventh proposition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Except downright asses!</em>” After twenty-seven years I
heard, from the lips of my own son, almost the very
identical words which Professor Roveni had used on the
memorable day of the examination. And this time they
were heightened by the savage irony of the added “<em>You
know very well!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>I wished to save appearances, and added in haste—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I know that. I was only in fun. I hope you
would not be such a fool as to be proud of a small thing
like that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, however, my Newton had repented of his too
sweeping assertion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all,” he went on, with some embarrassment,
“there are some who never attend to their lesson, and
then&#160;... even if they are not asses....”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed to me that he was offering me a loophole of
escape, and with a sudden impulse of candour—</p>

<p class='c009'>“That must be the way of it,” I said. “I suppose I
never paid attention.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How! You?” exclaimed my boy, reddening to the
roots of his hair. Yet&#160;... I would bet something that, at
the bottom of his heart, he was longing to laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>I put my hand over his mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush,” I said; “we will not pursue our inquiries into
detail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, the Theorem of Pythagoras has, as you see,
cost me a new and very serious humiliation. In spite of
this, I no longer keep up the old grudge. There will never
be any confidence between us, but I consider it as a family
friend whom we must not treat with rudeness, though he
may not be personally congenial to ourselves.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Of originals there is a great variety under the canopy
of heaven; and I have enjoyed the acquaintance of
several, but among them all I never met his match.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a Sardinian peasant, twenty years old, unable to
read or write, and a private in an infantry regiment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>The first time I saw him, at Florence, in the office of a
military journal, he inspired me with a certain sympathy. I
soon understood, however, from his looks and some of his
answers, that he was a character. His very appearance was
paradoxical: seen in front, he was one man; looked at in
profile, he was another. Of the full face there was nothing
particular to remark; it was a countenance like any other;
but it seemed as though in the act of turning his head he
became a different man, and the profile had something irresistibly
ludicrous about it. The point of his chin and the tip
of his nose seemed to be trying to meet, and to be hindered
by an enormous thick-lipped mouth which was always open,
and showed two rows of teeth, uneven as a file of national
guards. His eyes were scarcely larger than pin-heads, and
disappeared altogether among the wrinkles into which his
face was puckered when he laughed. His eyebrows were
shaped like two circumflex accents, and his forehead was
scarcely high enough to keep his hair out of his eyes. A
friend of mine remarked to me that he seemed to be one of
Nature’s practical jokes. And yet his face expressed intelligence
and good-nature; but an intelligence which was, so
to speak, sporadic, and a good-nature entirely <i><span lang="la">sui generis</span></i>.
He spoke, in a harsh, hoarse voice, an Italian for which he
had every right to claim the inventor’s patent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you like Florence?” I asked, seeing that he
had arrived in that city the day before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not bad,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coming from a man who had previously only seen Cagliari,
and one or two small towns in Northern Italy, the answer
seemed to savour of a certain austerity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you like Florence or Bergamo best?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I arrived yesterday—I couldn’t say yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The following day he made his entry into my quarters.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the first week I was more than once within an ace
of losing all patience, and sending him back to the regiment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>If he had contented himself with understanding nothing,
I could have let that pass, but the misfortune was, that
partly through the difficulty he had in understanding my
Italian, partly through the unaccustomed nature of his tasks,
he understood about half, and did everything the wrong way.
Were I to relate how he carried my razors to the publisher,
and my manuscripts ready for the press to the razor grinder;
how he left a French novel with the shoemaker, and a pair
of boots to be mended at a lady’s house, no one who had
not seen him would believe me. But I cannot refrain from
relating one or two of his most marvellous exploits.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_201.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At eleven in the forenoon—which was the time when the
morning papers were cried about the streets—it was my
custom to send him out for some ham for my breakfast.
One morning, knowing that there was an item in the paper
that I wished to see, I said to him hurriedly, “Quick! the
ham, and the <cite><span lang="it">Corriere Italiano</span></cite>.” He could never take in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>two distinct ideas at once. He went out, and returned
shortly afterwards with the ham wrapped up in the
<cite><span lang="it">Corriere</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>One morning he was present when I was showing one of
my friends a splendid military atlas, which I had borrowed
from the library; and he heard me remark to the latter:
“The mischief is that one cannot see all these maps at a
glance, and has to examine each one separately. To follow
the whole course of a battle I should like to have them
nailed up on the wall in their proper order, so as to form a
single diagram.” On coming in that evening—I shudder
still when I think of it—all the maps in that atlas were
neatly nailed to the wall; and, to add to my sufferings,
he appeared before me next morning, with the modestly
complacent smile of the man who expects a compliment.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all this is nothing to what I underwent before I had
succeeded in teaching him to put my rooms in order—I do
not say as I wanted them—but in a manner remotely suggesting
the presence of a rational being. For him, the
supreme art of putting things to rights consisted in piling
them one on top of the other, and his great ambition
was to build them up into structures of the greatest possible
altitude. During the first few days of his tenure of office
my books formed a semicircle of towers, which trembled
at the lightest breath; the washhand basin, turned upside
down, sustained a daring pyramid of plates, cups, and
saucers, at the top of which my shaving-brush was planted;
and my hats, new and old, rose, in the form of a triumphal
pillar, to a dizzy height. As a consequence there occurred—usually
at dead of night—ruinous collapses, which
made a noise like a small earthquake, and scattered my
property to such an extent that, if it had not been for the
walls of the room, no one knows where it would have
brought up. To make him understand that my tooth-brush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>did not belong to the genus hair-brush, and that the
pomade-jar was not the same as the vessel which contained
Liebig’s extract, required the eloquence of Cicero and the
patience of Job.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have never been able to understand whether my
attempts to treat him kindly met with any response on his
part. Once only he showed a certain solicitude for my
personal welfare, and this was exhibited in a manner quite
peculiar to himself. I had been ill in bed for about a
fortnight, and neither got worse nor showed any signs
of recovery. One evening he stopped the doctor—an
exceedingly touchy man—on the stairs, and asked him,
abruptly, “But, once for all, are you going to cure him,
or are you not?” The doctor lost his temper, and fairly
blew him up. “It’s only that it’s lasting rather long,” was
my orderly’s sole response.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is difficult to give any idea of the language he spoke—a
mixture of Sardinian, Lombard, and Italian, with idioms
all his own; elliptical sentences, mutilated and contracted
words, verbs in the infinitive flung about haphazard. The
whole was like the talk of a man in delirium. At the end
of five or six months, by dint of attending the regimental
schools, he learnt, to my misfortune, to read and write after
a fashion. While I was out of the house he used to practise
writing at my table, and would write the same word a couple
of hundred times over. Usually it was a word he had
heard me pronounce when reading, and which, for some
reason or other, had made an impression on him. One
day, for instance, he was struck by the name of Vercingetorix.
When I came home in the evening I found
<em>Vercingetorix</em> written on the margins of the newspapers,
on the backs of my proofs, on the wrappers of my books,
on my letters, on the scraps in the waste-paper basket—in
every place where he could find room for the thirteen
letters beloved of his heart. Another day the word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span><em>Ostrogoths</em> touched his soul, and on the next my rooms
were invaded by the <em>Ostrogoths</em>. In like manner, a little
later, the place was full of <em>rhinoceroses</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the other hand, I was so far a gainer by this extension
of knowledge on his part, that I was no longer obliged to
mark with crosses, in differently coloured chalks, the notes
I gave him to deliver to various people. There was no way
of making him remember the names; but he got to know
my correspondents as the blue lady, the black journalist, the
yellow Government official, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>Speaking of writing, I discovered a habit of his, much
more curious than the one I have mentioned. He had
bought himself a note-book, into which he copied, from
every book that fell into his hands, the author’s dedication
to his parents or relations, taking care always to substitute
for the names of the latter those of his father, his mother,
and his brothers, to whom he imagined he was thus giving
a brilliant proof of affection and gratitude. One day I
opened this book and read, among others, the following:—“Pietro
Tranci (the Sardinian peasant, his father), born in
poverty, acquired, by study and perseverance, a distinguished
place among men of learning, assisted his parents and
brothers, and worthily educated his children. To the
memory of his excellent father this book is dedicated
by the author, Antonio Tranci”—instead of Michele
Lessona.</p>

<p class='c009'>On another page he had copied the dedication of Giovanni
Prati’s poems, beginning as follows:—“To Pietro
Tranci, my father, who, announcing to the Subalpine
Parliament the disaster of Novara, fell fainting to the
ground and died within a few days, I consecrate this
song,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>What astonished me most in one who had seen so little
was an absolute lack of the feeling of wonder. During the
time he was at Florence he saw the festivities at Prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Humbert’s marriage, the opera, and the dancing at the Pergola
(he had never been inside a theatre in his life), the
Carnival, and the fantastic illumination of the Celli Avenue.
He saw a hundred other things which were quite new to him,
and which ought, one would think, to have surprised him,
amused him, made him talk. Nothing of the sort. His
admiration never went beyond the formula, “Not bad!”
Santa Maria del Fiore—not bad! Giotto’s tower—not
bad! the Pitti Palace—not bad! I really believe that
if the Creator in person had asked what he thought
of the universe he would have replied that it was not
bad.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the first day of his stay to the last his mood never
changed; he continually preserved a kind of cheerful seriousness:
always obedient, always muddle-headed, always most
conscientious in understanding things the wrong way, always
plunged in a kind of apathetic beatitude, always with the
same extravagance of eccentricity. On the day when his
term of service expired he scribbled away for several hours
in his note-book with the same calm as on other days.
Before leaving he came to say good-bye to me. There was
not much tenderness in our parting. I asked him if he was
sorry to leave Florence. He answered, “Why not?” I
asked him if he was glad to return home. He replied with
a grimace which I did not understand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you ever want anything, sir,” he said at the last
moment, “write to me, and I shall always be pleased to do
anything I can for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Many thanks,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so he left the house, after being with me over
two years, without the slightest sign either of regret or
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>I looked after him as he went downstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly he turned round.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” thought I, “now we shall see! His heart has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>been awakened. He is coming back to take leave in a
different sort of way!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Instead of which—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lieutenant,” he said, “your shaving-brush is in the
drawer of the biggest table, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With that he disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>... <span class='c014'>T</span>he newly-married couple settled in a small country
town, where they were not long in gaining the hearts of all
the inhabitants. The more sensible and influential people
in the place thought the advent of such wealthy residents a
great piece of good fortune. “They will be of so much
advantage to the place,” was the remark made in the
chemist’s shop of an evening. It soon began to rain
advantages: dinner parties, picnics, gifts, patronage, entertainments
for charitable objects—hospitalities of all sorts; and
then the balls at carnival-tide! A dash, a gaiety, a profusion
that one could neither believe nor imagine—a splendour, the
memory of which, as all the local journals put it, “would
flourish with perennial vigour in the hearts of a grateful
community.” We thought we had returned to the very
flower of the golden age of Arcadia. It was two talents,
more especially, which won golden opinions for Signor
Diego among the worthy citizens of our little borough—his
magnificent expenditure and his wit. Of Attic salt he had
as much as sufficed, within a very short space of time, to
pickle the whole place; whereby it became one of the
wittiest towns in the world. I do not say that the inhabitants
did not possess a great deal of wit before he arrived;
nor do I wish to hint that the conversation of the educated
persons who visited at the house of Diego was mere insipid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>triviality coloured with a little presumption, and that touch
of perfidy which is, so to speak, the <i><span lang="it">sauce piquante</span></i> of empty
gossip. No, indeed! for they, too, took their share in public
life and talked politics, speaking highly of themselves and
of the party in power, and exceedingly ill of those who were
not present to hear them. But what I mean is that Signor
Diego, profiting by all that he had learnt in his travels,
showed them a more excellent—that is to say, a more
Parisian way, and taught them the great mystery of <i><span lang="fr">chic</span></i>.
He instructed them in all those arts of gilding and veneering,
by means of which the most contemptible trifles may be
made to appear noble and graceful. He taught them to
laugh at serious matters, but to take the most religious care—practising
the worship of themselves with unheard-of
austerity and entire self-devotion—of their hair and their
coats, and the dignity of their attitudes and movements;
and to pronounce sentence with the extremest rigour on
the unfortunate who should transgress the least important
of the rules established by social etiquette.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_208.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Many years ago a
company, with
capital to back it, took
a lease of the manganese
mines in the province of
Valle Amena. Perhaps
the “Pleasant Valley”
may at one time have
deserved its name; but
nowadays there is nothing
pleasant about the monotonous barren hills, of no use
to any one but the goats, and the distant woods, too
scanty to lend any tint of green to the dry and desert
landscape. The company’s employés were scarcely to be
blamed for not liking the place; everything was scarce,
even pretty faces—at least such as had had the benefit
of soap and water. But the pay was good, and more than
one among them had hopes of becoming a shareholder,
or at least cashier; and so things went on somehow or
other. Two hundred navvies pushed the work rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>forward, and enormous trucks full of the grey metal
blocked the postal road day and night.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all that glitters is not gold; and one day the report
spread that the flourishing company had failed, as though
prosperity had undermined its foundations like stagnant
water. It made a great talk in the neighbourhood, and
every one concluded his or her comments by long exclamations
of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Mah!</em>” ejaculated the old, dried-up chaplain of the
<i><span lang="it">Misericordia</span></i>,<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> with his hands in the pockets of the threadbare
shooting-coat which he always wore except when he
put on his surplice to go and fetch the dead. “In my
opinion it was just like when a set of people leave the
gaming-table, where low cards have been dealt; but they
do not all leave with the same advantages.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no getting at the exact truth,” remarked the
landlord of the village inn, who did not repent nearly so
much of his sins as he did of having given credit; “but in
this business I too believe that the rogues have done the
honest men who trust their neighbours, and never suspect
any cheating.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What nonsense!” exclaimed Signor Vincenzino; and
perhaps he would have said more, only that, being syndic,
and very rich, he thought it possible he might be risking the
chance of a decoration. He rose from his seat in the Caffé
del Giappone. “In any case,” he continued, keeping his
back turned to the host, “there is the law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to see it!” replied mine host. “But it’s very
seldom that rogues who have grown rich do not find some
one to help them, in one way or another, in keeping what
they have stolen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Precisely!” retorted the chaplain, holding up his finger
like Dante under the Uffizi. “There are certain experts
and certain lawyers who show a most extraordinary ability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>in this respect, and acquire enormous credit, so that sometimes
the Government is even forced to raise them to the
rank of <i><span lang="it">Commendatore</span></i>. You alone, poor Phœbus...”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so on, and so on.... It would be tedious to
repeat all the conversation that took place at the Caffé del
Giappone. As to Phœbus, however, I should not be
altogether disposed to agree with the chaplain. If Phœbus
found no one to make the best of the arguments on his
side when—having been blinded by the effects of an
explosion at the works—he asked for a miserable little
pension, which the Company refused, saying that his misfortune
was due to his own carelessness, and not to the
necessities of his work,—if, I say, he had no one to plead
his cause, this must be regarded merely as an accident,
which happened to him, as it may happen to hundreds of
others in a like condition. Then came the crash; and if a company
were going to give every man what he wants, what motive
could it have for declaring itself insolvent. In this case, to
recommend the fulfilment of any humane duties is like running
after a mist-wreath, or asking a routed army, in full retreat,
to think of the dead and wounded they are leaving behind.</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not deny that the consequences were certainly
unpleasant for Phœbus, who had now eaten nothing for
three days, and sat in the chimney-corner, yawning and
stretching his arms to such an amazing extent, first in one
direction, and then in another, that he looked like the
castle of St. Angelo when the fireworks are being let off on
Easter Day. A miserable hen, which sat motionless, not
daring to attract attention to itself, and a cat which seemed
to have nothing more to wish for in this life, having now
reached the very utmost degree of leanness, and lay curled
up, with half-closed eyes, on the dead ashes of the hearth,
were the only creatures not audibly complaining in the
melancholy darkness of the hut, which covered so much
misery. It seemed as though they were meditating on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>infinite vanity of things. But not so Phœbus’s wife, nor
Vittorino, his little son; for the one, by continual whimpering,
and the other with her reproaches, added notes of
sickening despair to the symphony of those sonorous,
expansive, and well-nourished yawns of the blind man. Yet
the wife had not the slightest reason for envying the cat;
she was dry and thin as though she had nothing left for
hunger and grief to gnaw at;—she was near her confinement,
poor soul, and, with her face the colour of sodden
dead leaves, and her black
eyes, greedy, feverishly
bright, and sunken in
their sockets, she was a
very different person from
the comely young Rosalinda whom Phœbus had married
when he returned from serving in the <i><span lang="it">Bersaglieri</span></i>. That
was six months before the accident at the quarries;
and now she was more like one of the thirsty, dropsical
wretches in Dante’s “Malebolge.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_211.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Go to Sor Vincenzino,” said Phœbus.</p>

<p class='c009'>His wife did not reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go to the doctor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you know that a hundred poor sinners might die
before either of <em>them</em> would stir a finger? Don’t you know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>that the doctor keeps on asking me for a franc for that tooth
he pulled out last year?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Phœbus moved his jaws for a little while, like an animal
chewing the cud; then he gave seven or eight more yawns,
and rubbed his hands as if he had just concluded a good
stroke of business.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go to Nannone—go to the chaplain, to the archdeacon,
to Lisetta—only go to some one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I went to Nannone this morning—he was not at home.
I went to the chaplain yesterday, and he gave me that
bread. I went to Lisetta the day before yesterday, and she
gave me that <i><span lang="it">polenta</span></i>. And who’s going to the archdeacon’s,
with that vixen of a Modesta there? Not I!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, you ugly slug, you cannot be hungry, and must
just eat your own talk!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The wife rose, sobbing and muttering curses, and went
out, dragging the water-jar with her as usual, as an excuse for
knocking at people’s doors. When they opened, however, it
was something more than permission to draw water at the well
that she wanted—her errand was more serious than that.</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day she did not find them disposed to listen to tales of
misery, for it was the last day of the carnival, and the weather
was bright and clear. A cold wind kept the sky cloudless,
and the sun, going down in the west, seemed to embrace
the whole sky and earth with its rays, and smiled
among the shadows and on the peaks of the snowy Apennines,
which gradually faded away into the distance on the
last clear rim of the horizon. But the village, all but the
great ruined tower on the little piazza, the upper part of
which was still in light, began to grow dark; and it was
already dusk in the ancient, narrow streets, black as if after
a conflagration, filled with crowds of country folk, among
which the red shawls of the jolly peasant women made
bright points here and there, and noisy with cymbals and
other instruments, laughter, and shouting.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>This, then, was not a propitious moment. In fact,
Rosalinda was not long in returning, with her pitcher and
her hands both empty. The people, nearly all poor, were
tired of her continual requests, and by this time the pitcher
trick was becoming stale.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh!” said her husband, rubbing his hands as usual.
“I suppose they would not open their doors to you, because
it is winter, and they are afraid of the cold coming in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be quiet!” screamed Rosalinda to the child. “Be
quiet, or I’ll make an end of you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be quiet, Vittorino,” repeated Phœbus. “This evening we
shall have twenty loaves and some roast meat! Wife! you be
quiet too, and give me those things that ought to be in the box!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The things were a heap of rags, on the top of which lay a
worn-out tall hat, very old, but seeming still to remember its
former owner; for to those who had never seen him in any
other hat for years and years it was impossible not to be
instantly reminded of that wrinkled, benevolent, patient face,
whose serious sadness was rather added to than diminished
by the somewhat long chin and Dantesque nose. The other
things—a waistcoat, knee-breeches, and a very long black
overcoat—had very evidently belonged to an extremely poor
and unfortunate priest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Vittorino began to laugh and dance when he saw his
father put on not only this Court suit, as it seemed to him,
which his wife handed him, grumbling and crying at the
same time, but a pair of huge horse-hair whiskers and an
enormous paper collar, the points of which reached nearly
to the tip of his nose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not only this, but a wave of merriment ran through the
whole village, like the ripple which a puff of wind makes in
the surface of the lagoon, when Phœbus issued from his
door thus dressed, with a huge book containing the whole
series of ancient medical prescriptions under his arm. Some
people insisted on recognising in his icy smile, in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>remedies so learnedly prescribed in his slow, pompous
manner, in that awkward, straddling walk, Doctor Ambrogio,
the village physician for forty years, who was also surgeon,
veterinary surgeon, and dentist. As dentist his renown had
attracted people from the remotest villages; and for the
expense and trouble he had undergone to acquire it he
expected compensation even from the poor, though in
justice it must be said (and this shows Doctor Ambrogio’s
fair-mindedness), much less than from the rich.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other masks made a cheerful variation in the crowd—<i><span lang="it">stenterelli</span></i>,<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
with painted faces and pigtails curled up like a
point of interrogation, harlequins, Turks, madmen, wizards,
and big, bearded creatures got up as nurses, and carrying
turkeys swathed up in baby-clothes; which birds, pushing
their red-wattled heads out from among the bandages,
never imagined—though they seemed astonished and confused
enough already—the slaughter which was to befall
them later on. The women, with bright eyes and laughing
lips, hung over each other’s shoulders, in the windows and
on the balconies, to get a sight of Phœbus. Only when he
began to give utterance to certain jokes at which no girl—and
not even a married woman—can very well laugh in
public, then they knitted their brows, while the men,
looking at them, laughed fit to kill themselves. Then his
popularity grew; then it seemed as though Plenty thought
fit to empty her cornucopia over Phœbus; then the public
liberality knew no limits, and down were showered steaks,
and bread, and sausages, and <i><span lang="it">polpette</span></i>,<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> and <i><span lang="it">maritozzi</span></i>,<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and
<i><span lang="it">ballotte</span></i>,<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> and <i><span lang="it">strozza-prete</span></i>,<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and apples, and <i><span lang="it">schiacciatunta</span></i>,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>and rosemary cake, and millet puddings—all poured on the
devoted head of Phœbus, who, without putting the smallest
morsel into his mouth, stuffed the whole into the front of
his waistcoat, into his hat, and into all the pockets of his
overcoat and trousers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet none the less did he continue to look like Famine,
or Lent personified, come to play the fool in the midst of
all that courteous and kindly merriment. The clumsy
black spectacles—with the glasses broken and mended with
black sealing-wax—with which he covered the horrible sight
presented by his burnt eyes, seemed of themselves to darken
him, and take away every touch of life and mobility from
his worn face, white as old wax, which might have been
taken for that of an old man or one far gone in consumption,
if it had not been for the intensely black hair, and the
figure, which, though below the middle height, was broad
in the chest, and all muscles and sinews. If his hair had
been white he would not have moved people’s compassion
so much as he did when they saw him still fresh and
robust; for thus his lot appeared peculiarly unjust and
cruel, paralysing his strong arms, and robbing him of so
many years of ease gained by hard labour, and reducing
him instead to the necessity of asking alms, which were so
limited, and not always kindly given. Nevertheless, on
account of that habit he had of smiling and rubbing his
hands when speaking, many people thought him a merry
and light-hearted man who was fond of his joke.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shouting crowd hustled him out on the little square,
where rises the gloomy tower—at that moment lit up by
the last rays of the sun, with the hawks wheeling, in the
blue sky, round the top.</p>

<p class='c009'>Doctor Ambrogio, standing at the door of the chemist’s
shop, looked like Æsculapius himself, with his ruddy, well-nourished
face, full of severe learning, and his long white
beard, under which appeared, wound several times round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>his neck, a heavy scarlet woollen scarf. If this physician,
who was great at blood-letting and cupping, had remained
a little behind the times, the chemist had by no means
done so; and in this instance the old and the new generation
joined hands. For the chemist, emulous of his city
colleagues, had sold to a Florentine dealer in antiquities
the phials and vases of glazed terra-cotta and the dried
Nile crocodile, which, hanging with widely-opened jaws
from the middle of the ceiling, had formerly given an
uncanny idea of medical science and the apothecary’s art,
as though they had been devouring monsters. Moreover,
he had decorated his shop with all the latest improvements—gilt
boxes and ornamental stoppers, chalybeate water, and
purgative syrups enclosed in cut-glass bottles; and he never
sold an ounce of cream of tartar or bitter salts without
doing it up in a little bag of glazed paper. All this elegance
certainly raised the price of his commodities; but only consider
how much it added to the efficiency of the drugs!</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, right in front of this luxurious establishment, Phœbus
stood still, in the midst of the crowd, opened his book,
turned over the pages, and after discoursing for some time,
concluded by prescribing Dr. Ambrogio, who was still
standing in the doorway, and who suffered from sciatica, <em>a
decoction of asinine cucumber</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Ambrogio turned his back, closed the glass door, and
said to Sor Vincenzino, who was seated on the sofa reading
the paper: “This blind man is a public nuisance, and I
cannot think why you don’t get him out of the way. If I
were syndic....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you were syndic you would know what red-tape and
difficulties and formalities are! Last year I tried to send
him to the hospital for the blind at&#160;..., and they sent him
back because he was not a native of the place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I remember. I gave him as full a certificate as I
could to get him away from here. Good heavens! If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>this town is not a nest of wretchedness, I don’t know
what is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chaplain, who was also in the shop waiting for the
chemist, seemed touched to the quick, and said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the fault of the rich. If the rich were to think
more about giving work——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the doctor interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are with the rich again! Can’t you understand,
sir, that the rich have too many taxes?” The syndic nodded
approvingly. “It’s the Government that’s in fault,” said the
doctor. “Here’s the dilemma, and there’s no getting out
of it:—Either they ought to take off the income-tax, or they,
and not we, should see to the feeding of these starving
wretches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very true! Just the thing I have so often thought,”
answered the syndic. “Because if they were to take off the
income-tax, that sum would remain in the treasury; but it
cannot remain there, because the funds have to be turned to
account; and for doing this labour is needed, and labour
being needed it has to be paid for, and being paid for, why,
there you are. Then people have something to eat! Why,
that’s quite clear, gentlemen! No difficulty in understanding
that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was no need for your explanation,” returned the
chaplain, shrugging his shoulders with a slightly vexed look
as he rose from the sofa, stretching out his legs, which
appeared, long and thin as those of a blackbird, under the
skirts of his wretched coat. “Even the poor countess paid
income-tax; yet at the end of the year she had spent a
pretty large sum in good works. But her heirs have
inherited her money and not her merciful heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is just the sort of speech you might be expected
to make, belonging as you do to the <i><span lang="it">Misericordia</span></i>,” said the
doctor, with a quietly contemptuous smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a ruined man into the bargain!” whispered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Sor Vincenzino into the doctor’s ear. “Later on, some
time, I’ll tell you a little story about his niece.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Throwing away one’s own money in that fashion,” the
doctor went on, with a solemn air of wisdom, “is not
charity; it is merely carrying out the whims of hysteria; and
the countess was hysterical from the tip of her great toe
to the ends of her hair. It’s a question of organisation.
You’re far behind the times, chaplain!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You had better take care. I may be in advance of
you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything <em>may</em> be; but that there ought to be methods
and limits even in charity, for otherwise even great fortunes
would fall into ruin, this indisputable and precious axiom
of economic science, I am afraid—excuse me—you are not
acquainted with. And with interest, you know, there is no
joking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sor Vincenzino concluded his approving nods by one of
final and comprehensive assent; and wishing to convey
clearly to the chaplain that, in short, he thought nothing of
him, he turned his back on him, and set himself, with a
diplomatic countenance, to meditate over his newspaper.
The chaplain understood that, and with his simple face
full of grave sadness, and his white hair curling over his
temples, remained standing, waiting patiently for the
medicine for his poor, pretty niece, who was ill. The
doctor kept looking out of the window, and saying to himself,
“I should like to know what has become of the police!
They ought to make an example and dismiss them both!
If I saw one of them I’d tell him to make that rascal hold
his tongue!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-day I cure every one for nothing!” Doctor Phœbus
was shouting in the midst of the crowd. “To-morrow it
will be too late! Yes, it will be too late, unhappy people!
If you have not enough to live upon—if you do not pay me
a proper fee for every visit—if you don’t want to pay a high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>price for medicines, and buy them here of my good friend
the chemist, who is the only man who sells good ones—why
then, unhappy wretches, you can be no patients of mine!
Then you will have to go to the hospital—our hospital!—where
he who goes in never comes out any more! What
with fasting, and poultices, and gruel without salt, mallow-water
and cuppings, in a week you will either be cured or
gone where you want no more curing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this point the last glimmer of the fiery sunset, the
sound of the great church bell, and the rattle of a drum
which was going round announcing the “Last Wonderful
Comedy of the Burattini,” distracted the audience. A man
slipped out of the Caffé del Giappone, in the dusk, with
baking-pan full of pastry, just out of the oven, and hastened
to carry it to the Casino for the evening’s festivity. It
was duly evident from all the going and coming that there
were great things in the air. Not only at the Casino, but
there was to be dancing at Sora Carmelinda’s and at Sor
Gregorio’s; there was to be dancing at the taverns, in the
space between the wine-casks, and in the hay-lofts at the
farms; for all which occasions there had been secretly stored
up in every house masks and half-masks and <i><span lang="fr">papier-mâché</span></i>
noses, in which one could be perfectly certain of not being
recognised. Time was pressing; the drum had ceased to
beat and the bell to ring, and instead one could hear stray
barrel-organs, to whose sound little companies of peasants
came trooping in along the dark lanes; and here and there,
scattered through the streets of the merry little town, the
shouting and laughter which had previously been all
concentrated in the square. Then Phœbus found that he
had been left alone, in a deeper darkness than before. He
stretched out his numbed hands in order to give them a
joyful rub; but the long tight overcoat, now stuffed out with
the bounty showered on him, got in his way; he tried to stoop
and to raise his arms, but this too was a failure. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>impatient to get home quickly, and instead of being able to
do so he was forced to grope his way slowly along those
noisy streets, where he could scarcely find room to set his
stick down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wife! Vittorino! help! I can get no farther! Wife!
Come and help me unload the casks full of presents my
patients have given me!” he began to shout when he was a
few paces from the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>His wife and Vittorino hurried to meet him, and relieved
him of his load in a twinkling; and having entered the
house, all three ate like wolves, finding, moreover, here
and there among the spoils, a piece of cod’s head or a
rotten apple, flung for a joke, which were thankfully
received by the cat and the hen, now awakened; so provident
is Nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, unluckily, Phœbus said to his wife, “This evening,
at least, dear, you are not going to complain!” Alas!
it was like putting the match to the powder-magazine.
She had been quiet; but the words seemed to set her going
afresh, and she began again—shrieks, tears, and lamentations;
how much reason she had for complaining, and how
much for thinking of the next day, and how much better it
would have been if she had always remained single.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Phœbus began, in good earnest, to blaspheme like
a heretic, in the brutal Tuscan way. Yet, being quick-witted
and kind-hearted beyond the average, he understood
that such a burst of temper, after all anxiety had been removed
by so abundant a supper, could only have been caused
by the state of her health; and he resisted the temptation
of bringing her to her senses by a good beating. Instead
of that, he shuddered, pitied her, and sat down comfortably
in the chimney-corner without saying another word.</p>

<p class='c009'>But poor little Vittorino, cheered by the unaccustomed
supper, began to sing and jump about in that gloomy den,
just like a bird which has seen the sun rise. Only the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>woman felt as if her nerves were being torn to pieces by
the noise; and she thought the child, young as he was,
ought to have understood that there was cause rather for
crying than laughing. Then he began to cry; but that,
also, would not do; he was to be quiet and not let himself
be heard in any way. The child obeyed with a sigh, and
the mother then took him in her arms, soothing, petting,
and kissing him. But these caresses of his mother’s, who
was sobbing after having beaten him (the blind man was
singing to himself the whole time), could not draw a smile
from him; tired out and very serious, he fell asleep in her
arms, and she laid him down on the ghastly mattress and
stretched herself beside him. And after that there was
nothing more to be seen or heard in the room....</p>

<p class='c009'>They were all asleep, even Phœbus, who loved sleep
because it gave him back his liberty. By day, when he
was awake, there was always a cloud surrounding him, and
he fancied that he had to bore his way through it, as a mole
bores through the ground, to find the sun he had lost. But
that dark path went on and on, and never came to an end;
it was only in the darkness of night that he could even see
the sun again, when he slept and dreamed that he was no
longer blind, but could move about freely as before, with
his eyes open and seeing. Then he saw them all again—not
his little Vittorino, for the child had been born since
his misfortune, and the father had never looked on his bright
eyes and pretty features; but his wife, and his parents, and
his mates, and sometimes lovely distant landscapes that
he had never seen before.... He had never had such
beautiful dreams before he became blind....</p>

<p class='c009'>But that night he did not sleep sound, for a hand shook
him roughly as he sat in the dark corner of the hearth, and
recalled him to the reality of things—namely, to the belfry
tower to ring the bells, according to orders received from
the archdeacon, from eleven o’clock to midnight, in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to announce the beginning of Lent, and warn people against
breaking in on the fast and vigil.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the command, then, of Phœbus, still masquerading as
the doctor, two beggars, acting as his subordinates, who
had already entered the tower and seized the bell-ropes,
began bending their backs and rising again to the swing of
the bells—a “double” so loud and eloquent in the gloomy
silence as to reach even the most distant cabins, where
some ancient oaks marked the boundary of the parish.
But for a great many the bells tolled in vain. Nay, some
masks even went and stood under the archdeacon’s
windows, making unseemly noises, howling and whistling
with the intention of annoying him. And in some hay-lofts
the young men, laughing at the remonstrances of the old and
the continued tolling of the bells, kept up the dancing till
daybreak, amid the smoke of the pipes and the sawing of
the violins. The girls, it is true, were somewhat recalcitrant;
but with a few scruples of conscience and a little remorse, they
let themselves be whirled away, after a while, willingly enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>After ringing for an hour, Phœbus, hearing the
archdeacon’s maid-servant call him from a window,
entered, with his companion, the corridor of that
dignitary’s house, and having cautiously knocked at a
door, was told to come in. They entered a large room
lit by an old-fashioned brass lamp. Facing the door, at
a little round table, smoking and sipping punch, after
having finished their game at chess, sat the good
archdeacon, a jolly man of portly presence, verging upon
seventy; Cavalier Vincenzino, the syndic, with bye-laws
and civic enactments clearly written on the folds of his
brow and the curves of his mouth; and the preaching
friar, an elderly and hypocritical Franciscan, with red hair
and a round face, who had arrived that very day to preach
the Lenten sermons. When Phœbus and his companions
entered, the friar hid his modest little pipe in his wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>sleeve, and produced instead a snuff-box,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> from which he
immediately offered a pinch to the syndic and the
archdeacon, who readily accepted. The archdeacon, seeing
Phœbus appear before him in that burlesque costume, and
with that crushed and battered chimney-pot hat, threw back
the tassel of his black skull-cap, which was dangling close
to his left ear, and nearly choked himself with laughter.
Modesta, the maid, who made a glorious entry, carrying a
large dish of steaming meat-dumplings, hastened to set
them down on the other table, which was ready laid in the
middle of the room, so that she might scratch her head and
laugh, like her master—or even louder and longer. This
pleased neither the preaching friar nor the syndic, and they
whispered together, looking deeply scandalised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it">Persicomele!</span></i>”<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a> exclaimed the archdeacon, “are you
going about masked after the stroke of twelve? And what
sort of a costume might this be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the costume of a doctor of medicine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear archdeacon, my dear sir!” said the Franciscan,
pointing at Phœbus, “this suit of clothes has belonged to
a priest; do you not see the black stockings, the knee-breeches,
the waistcoat? Archdeacon, it is not the proper
thing to let the clothes of the clergy be seen in a masquerade.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it">Persicomele!</span></i>” exclaimed the archdeacon, looking more
closely, as he passed his hand over his knees, as if dusting
his breeches. “Who gave you these clothes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chaplain!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good! very good!” exclaimed the syndic, chuckling
with delight, but he immediately resumed the calm, severe,
and munificent aspect of the person who has to sign municipal
edicts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems impossible that, at the present day, certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>priests should have so little respect for their cloth!” said the
Franciscan indignantly. “Fatal effects, my dear sir!...”
And he took an enormous pinch of snuff, with both hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must not believe, reverend father,” replied the
syndic, with some heat, “that the chaplain gives the law to
our commune; he is a——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir!” exclaimed the archdeacon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you don’t know——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want to know. The chaplain is a priest, and
that’s enough! Find me another who for 260 francs will
take the services of the <i><span lang="it">Misericordia</span></i> the whole year round,
who will go ten or twelve miles on foot, in the depth of
winter, or in the dog-days, to attend a funeral, and that with
seventy years on his back! And then he has all his
brother’s family to keep—seven persons! But you were
only joking, Cavalier!—so never mind, let it pass.... And
as for you, you blind rascal, I must speak to you again about
this. You had no business to go masquerading in these
clothes, which were given you in charity. To-morrow, I
shall tell the chaplain to take them away from you again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a pity!” thought Doctor Phœbus to himself; “I
was going to make the overcoat into a nice jacket to wear
only on feast-days!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, to make a short story of it,” resumed the archdeacon
after some moments of anxious silence, “what did
you come here for—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We came to see whether it is time for the <i><span lang="it">polpette</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <i><span lang="it">polpette</span></i> are on the table; sit down, therefore, and
eat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fair and softly,” exclaimed one of the guests a little
later, giving Phœbus a tremendous nudge with his elbow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blind man, you’re going too fast!” cried the archdeacon,
looking at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I lose my sight if I have eaten more than two!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two!—you’ve eaten a dozen!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“The blind man has a good appetite! Well, there’s no
harm—his teeth will stand it!” said Modesta, who was
seated close by, counting the mouthfuls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well then, Modesta, my dear,” said Phœbus, “when his
reverence says, ‘Modesta, give the blind man a piece of
bread and some meat, poor fellow!’ why do you give me
nothing but little dry crusts and cheese-parings? Do you
take me for a mouse, Modesta?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blind man, blind man, you are never satisfied!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless your reverence!” said Modesta, “it would take a
great deal to satisfy him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, ’twould take little enough. I would be quite
content if I had the sight of my eyes again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good luck to you!” exclaimed the syndic at last, after
having for some time looked on in admiring silence at the
process of mastication and deglutition. “The like of us
would be dead in three days if they ate in that fashion!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just try a little abstinence!” said Doctor Phœbus.
“Try living all the year round on wild herbs and roots
boiled without salt, or roasted in the ashes. That’s my
prescription for you, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well,” said the syndic, “I would willingly exchange
my life for yours. You have no expenses; you pay no
taxes—do you think that a small thing? Now, I have to
spend the very soul out of my body; a little for the cat and
a little for the dog, and what remains for me? At the end
of the year—so much received, so much spent, everything
paid, and nothing over!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should just like to take you by the neck and hold you
down to our life for a month or so, so that you could try
it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that the way to speak to me?” said the syndic, somewhat
offended. “You ought to be more respectful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you must not think, my dear sir,” said the archdeacon,
“that the blind man is really wanting in respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>towards the authorities. Not at all! He may be a little
quick-tempered now and then, but when he recollects himself
he is a perfect lamb!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A kind of lamb which——” began the Franciscan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you expect?” interrupted Phœbus. “I used
to be as sweet as sugar; but now I am a little spoilt with
doing nothing. Now that I have tried it I find, in truth,
that the labour of a porter is better than the idleness of a
gentleman. Just set me to work in your factory, sir; let me
turn the wheel, and give me thirty centimes a day, and you’ll
see how the blind man works!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! indeed; you and your blarney!” retorted the
syndic. “Look here, I would willingly help you, but I
cannot. I shall have to shut up the works soon, to turn off
every one, even my cook. Are they making game of us
with these taxes? I don’t know how we can go on; I
haven’t ten shillings left in the world. It is not my place as
syndic to say so, but the fault certainly lies with the Government....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heigho!” said the blind man, “we shall be disappointed
indeed, if we are putting our trust in you, Mr. Government!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should put your trust in Providence, young man,”
said the preaching friar, “and come and hear my sermons!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed and he shall come to the sermons, and be
hanged to him!” exclaimed the archdeacon. “I’ll give
him a couple of eggs for every sermon; at Easter, so many
sermons and so many eggs. But if you miss one sermon,
you blind rascal, you shall get nothing at all!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put it in writing, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you blind scoundrel, are you afraid of my dying
first?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You, sir?—why, you’ll live to the age of Noah on the
clerical soups that Modesta makes for you! No; it’s I that
may die before Easter, and I should like to bequeath that
little legacy of eggs to my family!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Come, come, Modesta! never mind the blind man; it’s
time to clear the table. Don’t sit there keeping the brazier
warm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sakes alive!” exclaimed Modesta, looking into the
dish; “there were sixty, and there are only eleven left!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very sorry I didn’t eat them too!” replied Phœbus,
“but I’ll come to breakfast after the sermon to-morrow and
finish them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, come by all means; they’ll just do for you!” said
the archdeacon, giving a glance at the dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they made of meat or potatoes?” asked the Franciscan,
with another great pinch of snuff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of meat, of meat,” said Modesta testily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, there’s just enough meat to swear by!” said
Phœbus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even though there were but a piece the size of a pin’s
head,” said the friar as he took another pinch, “that would
be enough! To-morrow, you know, archdeacon, it’s a black
vigil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The friar is right! Do you want to go to hell for eating
<i><span lang="it">polpette</span></i> to-morrow! Persicomele! there’ll be no more
<i><span lang="it">polpette</span></i> now till next year,—so good-bye, my fine fellow!
Modesta, light the syndic to the door. Don’t you see
that he has put on his cloak, and wants to go? Good-night,
sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, archdeacon!” said the syndic, and then
turned to whisper in his ear, “By-the-bye, the chaplain
always stands up for all bad characters&#160;... and his
niece....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, whatever has the chaplain done to you?
Modesta, light these other people out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind me, I can see in the dark!” replied
Phœbus, going towards the door. “Modestina, dear, don’t
you bother yourself with the light; you’re using up too much
oil; you should be saving with it, Modestina!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“What are you thinking of, poor blind man?—such a
trifle as that!” cried Modesta. “Good gracious! we’re all
of us baptised Christians, and a little light costs nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The blind man, in going out, closed the door with
such a tremendous bang that he put out Modesta’s
lamp; and returning to his disconsolate hut, wished
two or three apoplexies to that meddling vagabond of
a friar who had deprived him of those poor clothes
and the remains of the supper, with which it was
the archdeacon’s annual custom to reward the four
poor wretches for their labours in the belfry. Having
reached his house, he told his wife the good tidings of the
eggs at Easter, and fell asleep in the time it takes to tell it.
But that night he saw in his dreams neither flowers, nor
cities, nor seas bright in the sunshine. He dreamed instead
that he was the stout director of the manganese mines,
and that he was sitting in a nicely-warmed room at a well-spread
table, and just tasting the full flavour of a fat roast
fowl. He was just at work on one of the legs when his wife
began to turn him over and call him to get up. He
struggled with his hands, feeling the director of the mines
gradually disappear, and a moment later he became aware
that he was only blind Phœbus. Then he hit himself a
great thump on the head, and started up because he heard
the bells ringing for sermon. When he had got into church
he sat down close to the sacristy door, so that the archdeacon
might be sure to see him. The preacher seemed to
be flinging squalls of rain and wind, and all the devils of
hell down from the pulpit on all the crowded, uncovered
heads. Phœbus paid no attention to him. When he came
out, certain good-for-nothing youngsters, loafing outside,
shouted after him—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phœbus! Phœbus! what has the preacher been saying?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know!” he replied. “I was thinking of the
eggs!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“By Bacchus! the archdeacon is quite right in thinking
him a little cracked! But I do believe that he would be
a true believer if he saw the Divine Master’s teachings
practised a little better, and also a little to his advantage!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was what the chaplain said to himself as he came
out from the service, with displeasure still written on his
face, and also a certain timid disgust, whether provoked by
living men or by the dead, whom he was constantly obliged
to see, I do not know.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>OUR SCHOOL AND SCHOOLMISTRESS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>We used to go to school, Sofia and I, with a certain
Signora Romola. They were very lavish with Greek
and Roman names in our village in those days. Teofilo,
Pompeo, Lucrezia, Collatino, Quintilia, were appellations
frequently bestowed in baptism. Signora Romola was a
strongly-built woman, plump and ruddy of face, and with a
soft voice, too soft indeed for the air of severity which she
wished to assume. It was her aim to strike awe into us
with a glance. In fact we scarcely dared to breathe in her
presence, by reason of that terrible glance which slowly
swept the class, and she always used to say that it was quite
sufficient. “I make them tremble with a glance,” she often
told people; and as soon as she made her majestic entrance
into school there was immediate silence, a fact of which she
was very proud. They used to say she had been a beauty
in her youth; I would not be persuaded of the truth
of this statement. Her husband was Signor Capponio
the chemist, who formed a complete contrast to her.
He was a long, thin, thread-paper of a man, with a
pair of great spectacles on his big nose, and sharp chin
and cheek-bones which seemed to make a triangle in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>honest face. He always wore a buffalo-skin cap, with a peak
curved like a bird’s beak. I always imagined that he must
have come into the world in that cap; I never saw him
without it. He could play the flute, and often performed
a tune for us boys during our play-hour, stamping vivaciously
with one foot, and accompanying with his head, no less
vivaciously, the motion of his fingers on the keys. We
stood around him with our noses in the air, as though we
had been gazing up at the top of a church tower, and held
out our arms trying to seize the instrument, whose construction
we were eager to examine; but, refusing to let go, he
played on as vigorously as before—or even more so—and at
last made his escape, saying, “You’ll spoil it! you’ll spoil
it!” He had the name of a learned man; and he must,
by what I have heard, have understood something of botany;
but I think his reputation was really founded on certain
sentences from Hippocrates and Galen, in Latin, written up
in gilt letters over the shelves in his ancient shop. The gilding
of the letters had turned black by reason of the flies which
swarmed there, on which, in the summer, Capponio used to
wage war—standing in the middle of his shop—by means
of a stick with long strips of paper attached to it. I do not
remember one of his many proverbs. He must have had a
large stock of them, for it was often said, “As Capponio
says, with his proverb! Eh!—honest man—<em>he</em> knows a lot
about the world!” I used to think that the proverb was a
person very much like Capponio himself—buffalo-skin cap
and all—but still taller and more serious—appearing now
here, now there—always unexpected, and at other times
invisible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Capponio was a great institution among us. Whenever
we saw him we rushed up to him, dragging him by the
skirts of his long, double-breasted, snuff-coloured coat.
And then he would lift us up to let us see Lucca,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a> or show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>us how to turn somersaults. If, passing through the school-room,
he saw one of us on his knees, with the fool’s cap on
his head, or his eyes blindfolded, he would try to make
fun of his wife’s austerities. She would sometimes inflict
punishments even more humiliating than these—for instance,
that most terrible one of all, of having to make crosses on
the ground with one’s tongue.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Capponio used to say, in a nasal tone, to make the children
cease crying and begin to laugh instead, which, in fact,
they did; and Sora Romola, who claimed an infallible
knowledge of “how to bring up young people,” grew uneasy
and said that Capponio was getting us into very bad ways.
But we were fonder of Capponio than ever, especially as
he was always giving us something—a bunch of grapes, an
orange, a pomegranate, or sticks of barley-sugar made by
himself. I was particularly fond of these last. In fact,
I once succeeded in perpetrating a crime which weighed
heavily on my mind. One day I was not allowed to go
home at twelve, but kept in to learn my lessons alone, in
school. Tired of catching flies, I went down very softly
into the shop while Capponio was at dinner. There
was no one there but a big cat comfortably asleep on the
counter, near the scales. I felt certain that the cat would
not report my theft to any one, and very quickly, with my
heart beating in a way that is not to be described, I filled
my pockets with the delicious transparent morsels, and ate at
least half a jar full, being determined, for once in my life, to
have really as many as I wanted. But Capponio found it
out; and, laying the blame on Camillo, the shop boy, ran
after him and seized him by the ear, crying, “Ah! you
greedy rascal! I’ve caught you!” When I saw the innocent
accused I could hold out no longer, and, coming forward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>I blurted out, “It was I!”&#160;... I remembered standing
there, very red, with my eyes on the ground, and expecting
a sound box on the ear. But Capponio only said, “Will
you promise me not to do it again?” “Yes, sir.” “Mind
you don’t, then. This time I will forgive you, because you
have told the truth; but if you ever do it again I shall tell
Sora Romola, and then woe be to you!”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Men, as well as women, speak ill of their neighbours;
there is no denying that fact. But they can never
do it as efficiently, and, in any case, they do not do it for the
same reason. Men nearly always speak ill of others because
they believe themselves greatly superior to those others;
and if there is a race in the world, every individual of which
believes that the phrase which calls man the lord of creation
was made for his own personal use, that race is the Tuscan.
Yesterday evening I was listening attentively to a dialogue
between a Livornese and a Florentine seated at a table in
the Giardino Meyeri. The conversation turned on the
English nation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The English,” said the Livornese, “are a selfish, heartless
nation, who, if the world were on fire, would think that
Providence had done it on purpose that they might heat
the boilers of their steam-engines without expense!” “That
is true,” replied the other; “the French——” “Worse than
ever!” interrupted the first; “a nation of barbers, of Robert
Macaires, who took Nice and Savoy out of our pockets—yes,
sir, out of our pockets, as a pickpocket does a handkerchief.
The Spaniards—boastful, proud, vain, ignorant, bigoted,
talkers. Come! speaking quite honestly, the Italians are
the first people in the world, after all! It’s true that the
Piedmontese are a little hard, the Genoese too keen after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>money, the Neapolitans superstitious, the Sicilians ferocious,
and that the proverb says: ‘Beware of a red-haired Venetian,
a black-haired Lombard, and any kind of a Romagnole!’
Every one must agree that Tuscany is the
garden of Italy, as Italy is the garden of the world, and that
the Tuscans, speaking without conceit, are the pearls of
mankind!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The home of civilisation is in Tuscany,” he went on.
“I have heard that said since my childhood, and always by
Tuscans, who surely ought to know! Not that I would not
admit that the Pistojans are all voice and pen, that the Aretines
are excessively devout, not to say hypocrites, that the
Siennese are vain, and the Pisans—why, Dante called them
‘the scorn of nations,’ and the Florentines—well! excuse
me, a little given to loud talking and short of action&#160;... but
the Livornese—ah! the Livornese are really the flower
of the Tuscans!... And you may say what you please,
but the finest street in Livorno is Via Vittorio Emmanuele,
where I live.... I don’t know how any one can stay at
Livorno and not have a house in that street.... It is
good living there—at least, that is to say, on the left-hand
side, because the sun never shines on the right, the houses
are damp, and any one who takes one on that side is
certainly an idiot. But on the left one can live like a
prince; and among all the houses on that side there is not
one like mine. I do not say that the other tenants are very
first-rate people—oh dear no!... On the fourth floor
there is an idiot, whose wife—well, never mind! on the
third, a nobleman, with plenty of pride, but no money; on
the second, a family all show and pretension, who spend their
money right and left in order to look more than they really
are, and who will assuredly come to ruin. On the ground
floor there is a wretch—a turncoat, a crawling insect who
has made money—no more of him! On the first floor I
live with my family. My home, I may say, is a real paradise....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>My father is dead—he was a gentleman!—a
little hot-tempered if you like, a little obstinate; but no
human being is without faults!... There is my mother,
who is old—well, one knows, inclined to be querulous and
tiresome; and my sister, who would be the best girl in
Livorno if it were not for a touch of ambition, and a slight
tendency to flirting; and then&#160;... there is myself. There!
it is not for me to say—but you know me. I am quiet,
peaceable, well educated; I am sincere; I know how to keep
within my means; I am—well, in short, I am what I am!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He might as well have said at once—“<em>I am the lord of
creation!</em>”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>SUNSHINE.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>I don’t say that the sun and I are great friends. I have
too much respect for my courteous readers (including
those who get their reading for nothing, by borrowing this
book instead of buying it) to permit myself the slightest
and most harmless of falsehoods where they are concerned.
I am not a friend of the sun’s, because I do not esteem him.
That way he has of shining indiscriminately on all,—of
working in partnership with everybody, from the photographer
who forges bank-notes, to the laundress and the
plasterer, seems to me to show a lamentable want of dignity
in the Prime Minister of Nature. Besides, I remember
that, many years ago, he was kept under arrest for twelve
hours by a gendarme of antiquity, Captain Joshua, who
must have had his reasons for taking so momentous a step.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps he was set at liberty again, because no grounds
could be discovered for taking proceedings; but, at the
same time, entirely respectable people do not, as a rule, get
arrested for nothing!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>However, the sun and I live so very far apart from one
another, that I cannot say I see the necessity of breaking
with him altogether. Every year, about the middle of
spring, I take a run down to the Ardenza, stop on the
sea-shore, pass respectfully in front of the villas and palaces
of the neighbourhood, and return home with an easy conscience,
and the feeling of having left my card at summer’s
door. So that, later in the season, when I meet the July
sun, a sun which is quite Livornese, a municipal sun (the
Corporation are extremely proud of it), we greet each other
like old acquaintances!...</p>

<p class='c009'>The July sun is a great benefactor to the Livornese. If
gratitude were still the fashion, he ought to be made syndic
of the city, and his painted image ought to figure on the
municipal shield, instead of the present device of the two-towered
fortress in the midst of the sea.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><em>WHEN IT RAINS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Suppose for a moment—and note, that when a man
says <em>suppose</em>, he is perfectly sure of his ground, and
woe be to any who contradicts him—suppose, then, for one
moment, that man is really a rational animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bizarre originality of being rational, which constitutes
the <em>last term</em> of the definition, does not prejudice the wisely
general character of the <em>first term</em>, which is this: Man is an
animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, I ask, what use is reason to a man, if it does
not make him take an umbrella when it rains? It is all
very well for you to think yourself superior to all other
created beasts,—to be proud of your learning, your science,
your experience, your laws, your noble blood, or your ample
income;—if you find yourself out in the rain without an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>umbrella, you will always be the most contemptible figure
in creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us be just;—humanity is not lovely when seen
through the falling drops of rain, by the cold, dull light of a
sunless day, under a dull, leaden, low, foggy sky, resting like
a cover on the circle of the horizon. All men wear faces
of portentous length; one can see that they bear an undying
grudge against meteorologic science, on account of that
phenomenon of aqueous infiltration which is so deadly to
new hats and old boots. They go their ways dripping
along the rows of houses, under the deluges from the water-pipes,
picking their way between the puddles, with countenances
cloudier than the skies, muttering the devil’s
litanies between their teeth with a muffled murmur like the
gurgling of a boiling saucepan. At every corner, such
accidents as making too close an acquaintance with the ribs
of an umbrella coming the other way, getting splashed with
liquid mud by a passing horse, or spoiling the freshness of
a new pair of trousers by means of an overflowing gutter,
provoke a glance which, if looks could kill, would be downright
murder,—a contraction of the facial muscles which
recalls the grin of the ancestral ape in a bad temper, and an
explosion of <i><span lang="it">sotto voce</span></i> ejaculations, expressing a pious desire
to see one’s neighbours in general attached to the muzzle of
a breech-loading mitrailleuse in full activity.</p>

<p class='c009'>... Now, to orthodox minds there cannot be the slightest
doubt on the subject; rain is by no means a fitting and
necessary part of the order of things; it is rather of the
nature of a judgment. The Scriptures make no mention
of bad weather before the time of the Flood. Rain-water
was in nowise needed for the development of germs or
the ripening of the harvest. Adam had been condemned
to water the earth with the sweat of his brow, and this
irrigation would have been quite sufficient to raise maize
and beans over the whole surface of the globe....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>From the preceding considerations it seems to me that
one can draw two principal conclusions:—</p>

<p class='c009'>1. That rain is not a necessity of Nature, but rather what
is commonly called a judgment of Providence.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. That human beings, when it rains, are exceedingly
ugly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take these two conclusions and put them aside; for we
may draw from them later on the most curious and unexpected
consequences....</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>... <em>Gianni.</em> I have three systems of making money;
one is that of the poet. Suppose, for example, there is a
wedding, a young man who has just taken his degree, a
dancer who has been a great success, a celebrated preacher,
a new member of the Chamber of Deputies,—I have a sonnet
which will do for any of them; it only wants the last
three lines varied to suit the occasion. I have six alternative
versions of those three lines. It is a revolver-sonnet;
you can fire six shots with it. Do you see? The two
quartets consist of philosophical observations on the joys
and sorrows of life; they will do for every one. In the first
tercet I descend from the general to the particular. “O
thou!” I say without further appellation. That <em>thou</em> has
neither sex nor age; it is equally suitable for man or woman,
old or young, noble or bourgeois. (Begins to recite, gesticulating.)</p>

      <div class='line'>Did grant of soothing woes that men endure.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>You see that is adapted to all, and the point of the whole is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the idea of <em>soothing the woes that men endure</em>. Now the last
tercet is, so to speak, the loaded cartridge in the revolver.

</div>

<p class='c008'><em>Petronio.</em>... I tell you I’m tired of it! And it is
you I complain of—you and your apathy, which poor
Virginia thinks she can cure by means of the stimulus of
jealousy! And I am to act the part of stimulus! But it is
a part I don’t at all relish, because when you come to look
into it, the stimulus, instead of acting on you, acts on me!
In other words, I am falling in love—do you understand
that? I am falling in love with your Virginia, my Carlo!
I am becoming your rival, my good friend!—and a neglected
rival, by all that’s contemptible! Because I am your friend
I speak of nothing but you when I am with her;—she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>accuses, and I defend you—you idiot! She doubts you,
and I keep on swearing that you adore her—blind fool!...
And all this is very dangerous to my virtue. For, while it
is quite true that I speak on your account, I feel my ears
burning on my own. It is true that Virginia is touched by
my words, because I, lying most vilely, keep telling her that
they are yours. But I know well enough that they are my
own words; therefore, is the look that flashes from those
great eyes of hers, as she listens to them, mine or yours?
I can’t tell, and the effort to find out causes such a
confusion of emotions—mine, thine, his, ours, yours,
everybody’s...—that my head spins round faster than
Angiolina’s reel. There, you have it now!</p>

(<em>Lays aside his gun.</em>) Here I am, back again. (<em>Looking

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa</em> and <em>Lauretta</em> (<em>astonished</em>). Dancing this evening!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Dancing.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> But you don’t think——?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> I never think—another general rule. Yes, I repeat,
there is to be dancing, and, what is better, you will dance
too.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> I, indeed!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Oh, yes! you shall dance, dear;—you shall come
with your husband to the party we have got up on the spur

say no—I beg you—I entreat you. As a friend, I entreat
you&#160;... (<em>Unbuttoning his coat.</em>) As a husband, I command
you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa</em> (<em>laughing as if in spite of herself</em>). You are a
queer creature!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Ah! you laugh?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> I may laugh; but you must not think I am going
to give way.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Then there is nothing for it but a story? the
resource of old-fashioned comedies. Well, listen now, and
you shall have your story.... This is how it happened.
Coming back from shooting, as we drew near the village,
we began to debate how we might spend the remaining
hours of this evening, up to the time of our departure, most
agreeably. We stopped in a meadow to form a club and
discuss matters. As usually happens in clubs, much learned
nonsense was talked and many absurd measures proposed....
At last some one suggested getting up an extempore
dance. The motion was negatived by the mayor and his
secretary, whose figures are obviously incompatible with any
kind of gymnastic exercise—except perhaps that to be
obtained on a see-saw. It was then that I carried my <i><span lang="fr">coup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>d’état</span></i>; we were all seated, look you, so I took in the situation
at a glance, and exclaimed, “The motion is put to the
vote. Those against it will kindly rise; those in favour of
it will remain seated.” Our two Falstaffs exchanged a look
full of anguish, and seeing that they could not record a
negative vote without the frightful exertion of rising from
the ground, preferred to affirm by remaining as they were.
The resolution was therefore passed by acclamation, and the
dance is to begin immediately in the drawing-room of the
Manfredi Palace, not far from this house.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> And what results from all this? That <em>we</em> are
going to this dance?—we, who have to start at daybreak!
Do think of it, Giuliano—the thing is impossible!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> How impossible?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Don’t you see? all my dresses are already packed
in this trunk; the tulle, the ribbons, and flowers in that
box; the gold ornaments locked up in my jewel-case....
I should have to open everything, turn everything upside
down; and the coachman may come any moment to fetch
the things.... No, no—it’s absolutely impossible!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Hm!—well, if there’s no help for it—if it is to cause
so much inconvenience.... Well—sometimes it is as well
to be reasonable....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Come now, that’s right.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Well—I’ll make this sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Yes, for my sake, well done!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Yes, for your sake, I’ll try to put up with it....
I’ll go alone.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Lau.</em> (<em>aside, laughing</em>). Oh! I didn’t expect <em>that</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span><em>Luisa.</em> But do you, or don’t you, understand that the

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Send him to the devil! I’ll take that much on

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Oh! I tell you what, this is mere childishness,

don’t feel fit for it, and I tell you I’m not going to open a

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> You’re not going to undo anything?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Quite sure?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Either you or I.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Do make an end of it!... There!—there’s no

the way, do! What is it you want?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Not much—shirt, socks, white waistcoat, black

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Haven’t you brought them?</p>

Do you know, by-the-bye, what varnished means? It
means that they have never been blacked by you.... A

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Tell me now, what did your mother say when she
saw you were such an idiot?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fran.</em> She said nothing, sir; she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Very good! Well, you can leave the trunk in the

not to turn so many things out....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Let me see&#160;... to whom should I devote my attention

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> But just think, dear; you’ll have to turn everything
upside down and undo all the boxes you have packed.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Never mind.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Then, you see, you have your dresses in this
trunk, your tulle and flowers and lace in that box, your
jewellery——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Do stop, you wretch! You want to have your
revenge on me; but it won’t do. I tell you I don’t mind;
I’ll turn out everything and come&#160;... that is, <em>if you want
me</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Want you? How can you doubt it? But you’ll
have to be quick.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa</em> (<em>running to Lauretta</em>). Oh! I’ll be ready directly,
never fear. Quick, Lauretta; just throw the things anywhere;
never mind where, as long as you can get at my dress.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Let us be clear about things, dear wife. Directly is
a relative term, and when it relates to a lady’s toilet it is
difficult to find a fixed standard by which one can judge.
Well then—(<em>watch in hand</em>)—how much time will you
require?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Oh! just think of it! A quarter of an hour—half-an-hour
at most.... I’m sure I shall not take three-quarters&#160;... or at any rate only a very little more.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Ah! ah! you’re just like Goldoni’s lawyer. Well,
try to make an effort, at any rate!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Oh! don’t be afraid; I won’t be a minute.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span><em>Giu.</em> I tell you what I’ll do: while you’re dressing I’m
going to throw myself on the bed to rest a little.... So
when you are ready, just tell me.... I shall not be a
minute dressing. (<em>Exit, but goes on speaking behind the
scenes.</em>) Mind, I want you to look your best. What dress
are you going to put on?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> The blue gauze.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> All right.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fran.</em> (<em>returning with the boots</em>). Where’s the master?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Lau.</em> In the bedroom. (<em>Exit Francesco.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fran.</em> (<em>behind the scenes</em>). Sir!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> (<em>in a sleepy voice</em>). Let me alone.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fran.</em> The boots are here, sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Go away with you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fran.</em> But you told me&#160;... (<em>Comes out on the stage,
followed by a pillow thrown by Giuliano. Mutters to himself</em>:)
After all, the proverb is right, “Let sleeping dogs
lie.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Really, in this house we are not likely to die of
melancholy. Come, Lauretta, and help me to get my
dress on.</p>

(<em>Goes to look out of window.</em>) Yes, indeed, that’s good!
I wonder how the mistress will manage to go to that
dance.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa</em> (<em>within</em>). Francesco!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fran.</em> Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Is it raining?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fran.</em> I’m afraid so.... If you’ll allow me, ma’am, I’ll
go away to my room; you can give a call whenever you

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa</em> (<em>within, Lauretta</em>). My good man, we are going
to a dance.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Cav.</em> And when will you start?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> We shall start later.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Cav.</em> But that does not suit me at all, ma’am! Do you

<p class='c009'><em>Giuliano</em> (<em>within, awaking</em>). What’s the matter there?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Oh! that will be all right. Giuliano, would you

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> (<em>half asleep</em>). Don’t bother me now.... I’ll pay
you extra.... We’ll make two days’ journey of it....
Anything you like, as long as you go away now.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Cav.</em> Ah! if you’re willing to stop half-way, I have no
more to say; on the contrary, I am glad of it, because one
of my horses has a pain——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Ah! you scoundrel! (<em>Exit Cavallotto, shrugging

what he means to do if it rains.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Lau.</em> After all, it is only a few steps to the Manfredi
Palace.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span><em>Luisa.</em> That is true; but at any rate it is time to call him,
Giuliano!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> (<em>within</em>). What is it?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> It’s time to get up.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> What a bother! I was sleeping so comfortably.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Come, be quick!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Tell me, Luisa, have you really set your heart on
going to this tiresome dance?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Oh, indeed! if you’re not enough to provoke a
saint!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Calm yourself, my dear; I’m coming. (<em>Enters in
his dressing-gown. He sits down near the front of the stage.</em>)
See here; while I was in there on the bed, my dear girl, I
was reflecting seriously——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Do tell the truth, and say you were sleeping
deliciously!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> That may be, but even in sleep the mind continues
its intellectual processes, and, as I said, I thought over your
judicious observations....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa</em> (<em>vexed</em>). Really, this is too much! First you nearly
drive me out of my senses, till I made up my mind to
come with you to the dance; then, when I have turned
out all my boxes, and taken the trouble to dress, and am all
but ready, you want&#160;... <em>Will</em> you be kind enough not to
carry the joke too far?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Enough! let us perform this heroic action! Francesco!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span><em>Luisa.</em> Oh! it’s not ended yet.... If you only knew&#160;...
I am terribly afraid.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Lau.</em> What about?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> I am afraid I have given Giuliano the wrong pair
of trousers&#160;... those that did not fit, and made him so
angry....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Lau.</em> Those that he threw at the tailor’s head after the
first time of trying them on?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Yes, those....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> (<em>from within</em>). Luisa!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa</em> (<em>aside to Lauretta</em>). Ah! didn’t I say so? (<em>Aloud.</em>)
What is it?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Which trousers have you given me?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> I&#160;... I don’t know....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> They are those that ass of a tailor made.... I

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Can’t they? I tell you it is the very pair.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> But do be persuaded....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Persuaded, indeed! Why, of course they are the
same; and if you don’t give me another pair I shall not
come.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> And I tell you that I don’t feel the least bit
inclined to pull all the things out of another trunk....
It’s nothing but excuses to make me stay at home. But
anyway——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Oh, heavens! another sermon! No, no—do be
quiet. I’ll resign myself, and try to endure.... Francesco,
my boots! (<em>He puts them on at the back of the stage, turning
his back on the audience.</em>) Gracious, how tight they are!...
curses on that shoemaker! How am I to hold out with my
feet in these? (<em>Rises and walks about stiffly and clumsily.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span><em>Luisa.</em> Another excuse!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Excuse! I tell you it feels as though I had my feet
in a vice. I can’t move.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> After all, you’re not going to play at tennis.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Well, and what then? If a gentleman does not
feel disposed to take part in the noble game of tennis, is he
to be laced up so that he cannot move?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa</em> (<em>angrily</em>). In short—I understand! Do you
wish to stay at home? Does it bore you to come to the
dance? Do you want to go to bed? We will stay at home—we
will not go to the dance—we <em>will</em> go to bed!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Mind that I do not take you at your word.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Luisa.</em> Much it matters to me if you do! Come, Lauretta,

<p class='c009'><em>Marco.</em> Well done! you are just dressing.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> <em>Just</em> so—we were just dressing. What’s the news?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Mar.</em> The news is, that it is raining, and in this weather
none of the ladies will be coming to our improvised party.
We therefore thought of sending a carriage for them.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Well?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Mar.</em> It’s not so well. A carriage is not so easily found
in our village.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> I understand. If it were a cart, now....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Mar.</em> We found one, however; a fine, commodious
coach, to hold six people——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> An ark, in short—just the thing for this threatened
universal deluge. Well, what then?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Mar.</em> The worst is, we cannot get——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> The horses?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Mar.</em> Precisely. The owner sold them last week, to
buy——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Hay?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Mar.</em> No, to buy a yoke of oxen.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Well, why don’t you harness the oxen?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Mar.</em> Just like you—you must have your joke. Listen,
now—this is what we thought of doing. There are two
cab-drivers in the place; we have made arrangements with
them to fetch the ladies in their cabs.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Very good.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Mar.</em> So I have come to give you notice that in a little
while they will be coming round for your wife and you—so
try to be ready.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span><em>Giu.</em> But really....</p>

don’t come in the cab, we’ll come to fetch you with a stick.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> No—not that. Bruises for bruises, I prefer those of
the cab. I’ll come.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Giu.</em> Yes; the victim is prepared for the sacrifice! Just

  <h2 class='c005'><em>A LOST EXPLORER.</em><br> <span class='large'>FROM THE COMEDY “CORVI” (CARRION CROWS).</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Bertrando, the editor of the <cite><span lang="it">Demos</span></cite>, and Serpilli, the
publisher, have just received word of the death of
their friend Arganti, who had gone on an exploring expedition
into the Soudan.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bertrando.</em> I have just sent the confirmation of the sad
news. Poor Arganti! This sudden loss has quite paralysed
me. It is all very well to make a parade of one’s want of
feeling and pretend to be a cynic; but when the thunderbolt
falls at your very feet....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Serpilli.</em> Just so; but, <em>I</em> say, what mad notion was it that
made him go and get himself killed out there? At fifty,
too! Were there not enough hare-brained young fellows
eager to discover new outlets, new resources for commerce,
for industry, for African humanity, which, by-the-bye, loves
us as well as people love the smoke in their eyes?...
Wasn’t he quite comfortable here, in this charming house,
with the best of wives? No, sir! He must needs be off
poking his nose into other people’s affairs!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ber.</em> You forget how many years he had travelled—and
the love of science——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> One might get over it if the misfortune had been
confined to the dead, but it also touches the living!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ber.</em> Serpilli!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> My dear fellow, it’s all very well for you to talk; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>I have undertaken a complete illustrated edition of all his
travels.... Sixty thousand francs, do you understand? I
am ruined!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ber.</em> Do you think this is the time——?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> Yes, yes, certainly—I mourn for him—I am deeply
grieved; but who will give me back my sixty thousand
francs? It’s ruin—it’s bankruptcy!... Oh! who would
have thought it? And it must happen to me, of all men in
the world!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ber.</em> Come, have done with this! Who prevents your
continuing the issue? Surely Arganti’s writings have not
lost their value through his death?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> What interest can attach to his expedition to
Palestine, undertaken twenty years ago, now that people
can make a holiday excursion of it and travel by rail?
It needs something else to tickle the palate of the public,
who, nowadays, are perfectly familiar with Afghanistan,
Zululand, Basutoland,—not to mention journeys to the
centre of the earth, to the bottom of the sea, and the sphere
of the moon! My poor sixty thousand francs!... If he
had lived it would not have been so bad. With a Mutual
Admiration Society such as the fashionable papers know how
to get up, something might have been done. But now that
Arganti is dead, who is going to waste his time in praising
him? You will have your time fully taken up in bringing
out some new genius—one of those startling and powerful
ones who open new horizons to the heart and mind, to
science, and their country every quarter of an hour! And
I shall be sacrificed!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ber.</em> You are both ungrateful and mistaken. You have
made quite a nice little sum out of our poor friend’s works,
which we advertised for you at reduced prices and reviewed
in special articles!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> Why, I have spent the whole on advertising the new
edition; and now, just as I am about to reap the fruits of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>judicious puffing, everything is upset by death—the one
thing I had not calculated on.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ber.</em> Serpilli! Serpilli!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> It is enough to bring on an attack of the
jaundice! If Arganti had at least confined himself to
writing a couple of volumes!... No, sir! Twenty-seven!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ber.</em> Would you, out of sordid self-interest, wish
the scientific and literary heritage of the nation to be
diminished?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> You are laughing at me. You are quite right;
I have been an idiot.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ber.</em> I respect every one’s convictions.</p>

great misfortunes vibrates the heart of great nations.”...</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Per.</em> (<em>enters hurriedly</em>). And of all great artists.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ger.</em> The sculptor Peralti, a dear friend, one of our
associates.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> (<em>to Peralti</em>). Have you heard, too?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Per.</em> I have read some twenty or thirty telegrams posted
up at the street corners, and have at once hastened here to
present to the widow this design for a monument to be
erected to her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span><em>Ser.</em> Did you have it ready?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Per.</em> An artist never lets himself be taken unawares.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ger.</em> You have the instinct of genius!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Per.</em> (<em>unrolling a sheet of paper which he holds in his hand,
and giving it to Geronte</em>). You see, a large pedestal with
three steps—two sleeping lions, in Canova’s manner—a
cubic block of granite, which has a philosophic signification.
The statue is seated on a curule chair.... Just look at the
subtlety, the diapason, the <em>tonality</em>, the depth of the <i><span lang="it">tout
ensemble</span></i>!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> But surely this is the drawing you made for Professor
Giulini.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ger.</em> (<em>handing the paper to Serpilli</em>). I thought I had
seen it exhibited as a design for a monument to General
Quebrantador.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> (<em>handing it to Peralti</em>). Not at all. I tell you——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ger.</em> And I maintain——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Per.</em> Calm yourselves, gentlemen. The artist of any <i><span lang="fr">élan</span></i>
dashes off his idea just as genius inspires him.... It will
then serve its purpose when a purpose is made apparent.
(<em>Rolls up the drawing.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ger.</em> Bravo! I hold exactly the same theory with regard
to my own science. I prepare the acids....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> Excellent! Go and tell Signor Bertrando.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fran.</em> (<em>lays the telegrams on the table</em>). Oh! by-the-bye,
I was forgetting.... What has become of my head?...
There is a photographer outside who will insist on seeing
the mistress.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Per.</em> Only give me 50,000 francs, and Arganti shall have

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> What do you want, sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pho.</em> I saw all the telegrams posted up. Every one was
in a state of consternation, asking who Arganti was....
Having made inquiries on the subject, I hastened hither
with my camera, and would now request the favour of taking
a photograph of the illustrious Arganti’s portrait....
Begging your pardon, what was his Christian name?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> Ettore.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pho.</em>&#160;... Poor Ettore’s portrait. I will guarantee a
work of art that shall be a tremendous success! I am also
going to take photographs of his bedroom, his study, his
inkstand, the front of the house—everything!—and to
advertise them in all the papers.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> (<em>shaking him by the hand</em>). I thank you in the name
of the family. To honour the noble dead is not only a
work of merit—it is a duty: a duty which we are here to
carry out.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ger.</em> I alone can do nothing.... Ah! Signor Serpilli!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ser.</em> Since common feelings of delicacy have assembled us
in this spot, let us take steps for transferring to the public
the conviction of the greatness of our loss. (<em>Rings the bell.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pho.</em> Poor Ettore!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Per.</em> Poor, dear fellow!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> No, sir, I had not forgotten you. Am I a man to

</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> We are, indeed! Twenty years——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> No, not twenty years; eighteen or nineteen....
We used to see a great deal of each other—do you
remember?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> Don’t I?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> We often used to dispute; because you are of a
most contradictory temper.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> I?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> Would you deny it?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> Well, no—I was young and impetuous in those
days, and had not much sense—or indeed none at all.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> That is not the case—you were not altogether
without sense.... It is true you had your little eccentricities—but,
after all....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> And you never paid the slightest attention to my
words....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> That is not true! I always attended to you—I
always had the greatest consideration for you, I assure you;
and it gives me more pleasure than I can express to find
you here again.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> You must come to see my wife.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> I do not know whether Signora Angelica will be
disposed to welcome me after all these years.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> Of course she will! I’ll answer for that! Why—an
intimate friend of mine! Yet she does everything she
possibly can to contradict and oppose me, that woman!—She
has not a bad disposition—I would not say that; but
it is a certain perversity of humour. Just imagine that, at
this very moment, when all the visitors present in the place
are going to assemble in these rooms, she could find no
better way of spending her time than in going off for a long
walk on the beach. Never lets herself be seen—persists in
withdrawing from society—mere madness, I call it!...
We have a daughter, and if this sort of thing goes on, how
shall we ever get her settled in life?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> Oh! as to that, the young lady cannot fail to
find——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> What! are you, too, going to contradict me?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> No, most certainly not! Only, since the ladies are
going out, if you will permit me, I should like to accompany
them for part of the way.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> Hm!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> I will just go and fetch my hat and umbrella.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> (<em>aside</em>). What a bore he is—always in the way!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> (<em>aside to Benini</em>). Signor Pandolfo appears to have
a great regard for you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> (<em>aside to Paolo</em>). Quite true; there was a time when
I could get him to do anything I wanted.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> (<em>as before</em>). Do, like a good fellow, one thing for
me,—say a word or two in my favour.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> (<em>ditto</em>). In your favour? All right! It is just what
I was thinking of doing.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> (<em>ditto</em>). Thanks!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span><em>Ben.</em> (<em>ditto</em>). Oh! you’ve nothing to thank me for.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> (<em>aside</em>). Now I’ll do his business. (<em>To Pandolfo.</em>)
I understand why you gave permission to that young man
to escort your wife and daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> Good-looking——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> A dandified fool!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> Courteous——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> Too much so. The fellow agrees with every one.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> He would be a son-in-law quite after your own
heart. I would, but——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> Son-in-law, be hanged! If you don’t look out you
will make me use language I shall regret!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> Well, don’t get angry.... Every one believes that
he is going to marry your daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pan.</em> Then he may whistle for her. My Elisa’s husband
ought to be a young man with brains; and this Galanti of
yours is a fool.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ben.</em> Well, not quite that.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>[Paolo Severi is in love with his cousin Evelina, who, unknown to
him, is being courted by his old schoolfellow, Adolfo Briga. Briga
purposely encourages his rival, who is from the country and unused to
society, thinking that he will be sure to make himself ridiculous, and
so fail. In order the better to carry out this plan he pretends to devote
himself to Graziosa, the daughter of the President Manlio, who is visiting
at the house of Evelina’s parents. Paolo, in his simplicity, does his best
to further Adolfo’s suit by pleading his cause with Signora Vereconda,
Graziosa’s mother, a lady whose love of admiration has survived her
youth, and who has taken Briga’s attentions as a homage to herself.]</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Scene—A drawing-room in the house of the Advocate Scipioni,
with a door opening on the garden. Adolfo and Vereconda
seated, in conversation. Enter Paolo from the garden
just as Adolfo kisses Vereconda’s hand.</em></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Paolo</em> (<em>aside</em>). “If you want canes, you must go to

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> Am I intruding?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> Do you think...?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> I have just come in to fetch a volume of my aunt’s
poems.... Here it is. I am very sorry that my aunt
should expose herself to ridicule by publishing verses like
these, in which even the syntax and spelling are wrong!
I have a good mind to tell her so myself....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Adol.</em> (<em>aside to Paolo</em>). So you have left Evelina? Well
done!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> (<em>aside</em>). Well done, indeed! It was not <em>my</em> choice!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Adol.</em> (<em>aside</em>). But, indeed, it is a capital manœuvre of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>war! A woman entreated denies, and neglected entreats!
Do you remain here instead of me.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> (<em>aside</em>). No, indeed!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Adol.</em> (<em>aside</em>). Yes, indeed! I’ll go and speak artfully for
you in the other quarter, and put things right for you in no
time!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> (<em>aside</em>). But——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Adol.</em> (<em>aside</em>). I’ll beat the big drum for you, you shall
see! Let me go!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> (<em>aside</em>). All right. Go!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Adol.</em> (<em>aside to Vereconda</em>). I have removed all suspicion
on his part.... I am going away to make things quite safe.
(<em>Aloud.</em>) Will you excuse me, Signora Vereconda?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> Do as you——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> And take in my stead these&#160;... well, let us call
them verses. Don Vincenzo, rest his soul, would have
called them “uncultivated, rugged songs, which have brought
a blush to the revered countenances of Apollo and the
Muses.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>to Adolfo, aside</em>). Who in the world was this Don
Vincenzo?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Adol.</em> (<em>aside to Vereconda</em>). Who knows?... Ah! I
have it: the schoolmaster at Borgo di Castello! (<em>Exit.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>aside</em>). How one always recognises the country lout
at once!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> (<em>aside</em>). What a first-rate friend Adolfo is! And now
that I am with his Graziosa’s mother, could I do him a
service? I should be ungrateful if I did not try; but I too
am a real friend.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>aside</em>). He looks as though he had just come from
the plough-tail.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> Madam....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> Sir?...</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> If you permit&#160;... if I am not wearisome to

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span><em>Ver.</em> Pray sit down.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> To supply the place of my friend is no easy job.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>aside</em>). How vilely he expresses himself!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> There are very few like him; he is a fellow who is
liked by every one&#160;... particularly by girls’ mothers....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>aside</em>). Could he have noticed anything?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> He is very fortunate; but he deserves to be so....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>aside</em>). He must have noticed. (<em>Aloud.</em>) I don’t
understand....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> Now, look here; Adolfo has no secrets from
me.... How could he? We have been friends from
childhood....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> What is all this to lead up to?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> This—that the poor old fellow has opened his whole
heart to me, and has told me in particular that you are
inclined to look on him with favour.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> Infamous! To go and say so!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> And he hopes&#160;... yes, I say hopes, that you will
grant his request.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>rising</em>). What does he want of me?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> Why—from a mother as affectionate as you—what
but the hand of your daughter?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> What do you say?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> Believe me, there is no young man more worthy to
possess her. He loves her—loves her devotedly; but the
poor fellow wants some encouragement—some protection.... Oh, do take him under your protecting wings!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>choking with suppressed vexation</em>). Ah!... under
my wings?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pao.</em> I have already given him a hint as to his right
course. “If you want canes, you must go to the cane-brake....”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ver.</em> (<em>aside</em>). You and your cane-brakes!</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>One species
of wit and
humour in which Italians
have always excelled
is the impromptu epigram—the
stinging comment in verse
on passing events. The language
abounds in rhymes, and easily lends
itself to metre; and it is rare to meet
with an Italian, however uneducated, who
cannot string together a few lines of at least passable quality.
Any family event—a marriage, a baptism, or a death—is sure
to call forth a shower of sonnets from friends and acquaintances;
and on special occasions these contributions are
published in volume form. Most of these, indeed, are dull
enough reading; but the satirical verses suggested by
public events are often amusing enough, though sometimes
so local in their application as to have little meaning or
interest to outsiders. Many of those translated in the
following pages are in Latin, but the knowledge of this
language was common enough in Rome to make them
almost as popular as verses in the vulgar tongue; and it
must be remembered that any Italian with the smallest pretension
to culture can turn out a few Latin elegiacs indifferent
well. At least this was the case under the <i><span lang="fr">ancien régime</span></i>,
when such education as was to be had was almost exclusively
classical.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>This tendency to satiric comment was curbed, but never
quite repressed, by the censorship of the <i><span lang="fr">ancien régime</span></i>. In
Papal Rome it found an outlet in Pasquin, whence the
word <i><span lang="it">Pasquinade</span></i> has passed into most of the languages of
Europe. Concerning Pasquin, and the epigrams for which
he became responsible, we cannot do better than quote from
Story’s <cite><span lang="it">Roba di Roma</span></cite>.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“The only type of true Roman humour which now remains
since the demise of <em>Cassandrino</em> is <em>Pasquino</em>. He is the public
satirist, who lances his pointed jests against every absurdity
and abuse. There he sits on his pedestal behind the Palazzo
Braschi—a mutilated torso which, in the days of its pride,
was a portion of a noble group, representing, it is supposed,
Menelaus dragging the dead body of Patroclus from the
fight.... Whatever may have been the subject of this once
beautiful and now ruined work it is scarcely less famous
under its modern name. Pasquino is now the mouthpiece
of the most pungent Roman wit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The companion and rival of Pasquin in the early days
was Marforio. This was a colossal statue representing a
river-god, and received its name from the Forum of Mars,
where it was unearthed in the sixteenth century. Other
friends, too, had Pasquin, who took part in his satiric
<i><span lang="it">conversazioni</span></i>, and carried on dialogues with him. Among
these was Madama Lucrezia, whose ruined figure still may
be seen near the Church of St. Marco, behind the Venetian
Palace; the Facchino, or porter, who empties his barrel still
in the Corso, though his wit has run dry; the Abbate Luigi
of the Palazzo Valle; and the battered Babbuino, who still
presides over his fountain in the Via del Babbuino, and
gives his name to the street, but who has now lost his
features and his voice. Marforio, however, was the chief
speaker next to Pasquin, and he still at times joins with
him in a satiric dialogue. Formerly there was a constant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>strife of wit between the two; and a lampoon from Pasquin
was sure to call out a reply from Marforio. But of late
years Marforio has been imprisoned in the Court of the
Campidoglio, and, like many other free speakers, locked up
and forbidden to speak; so that Pasquin has it all his own
way. In the time of the Revolution of 1848 he made
friends with Don Pirlone and uttered in print his satires.
<cite><span lang="it">Il Don Pirlone</span></cite> was the title of the Roman Charivari of this
period. It was issued daily, except on <i><span lang="it">festa</span></i> days, and was
very liberal in its politics, and extremely bitter against the
<cite><span lang="it">Papalini</span></cite>, French, and Austrians. The caricatures, though
coarsely executed, were full of humour and spirit, and give
strong evidence that the satiric fire for which Rome has
been always celebrated, though smouldering, is always ready
to burst into flame. Take, for instance, as a specimen, the
caricature which appeared on the 15th of June 1849. The
Pope is here represented in the act of celebrating mass.
Oudinot, the French general, acts as the attendant priest,
kneeling at the step of the altar, and holding up the pontifical
robes. The bell of the mass is the imperial crown.
A group of military officers surrounds the altar, with a row
of bayonets behind them. The altar candles are in the
shape of bayonets.... On the sole of one of Oudinot’s
boots are the words, ‘<i><span lang="it">Accomodamento Lesseps</span></i>,’ and of the
other, ‘<i><span lang="it">Articolo V. della Costituzione</span></i>,’ thus showing that
he tramples not only on the convention made by Lesseps
with the Roman triumvirate on the 31st May, but also on
the French constitution, the fifth article of which says, ‘La
République Française n’emploie jamais ses forces contre la
liberté d’aucun peuple.’<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Beneath the picture is the motto,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>‘He has begun the service with mass, and completed it
with bombs.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the 2nd July 1849 the French entered Rome, and
<cite><span lang="it">Il Don Pirlone</span></cite> was issued for the last time. The engraving
in this number represents a naked female figure
lying lifeless on the ground, with a cap of liberty on her
head. On a dunghill near by a cock is crowing loudly,
while a French general is covering the body with earth.
Beneath are these significant words, ‘But, dear Mr. Undertaker,
are you so perfectly sure that she is dead?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“That day Don Pirlone died, and all his works were
confiscated. Some, however, still remain, guarded jealously
in secret hiding-places, and talked about in whispers; but if
you are curious, you may have the luck to buy a copy for
30 or 40 Roman scudi.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first acquaintance we make with Pasquin is as an
abandoned, limbless fragment of an antique statue, which
serves as a butt for boys to throw stones at, and for other
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Near by him lives
a tailor, named Pasquino, skilful in his trade, and still more
skilful in his epigrams. At his shop many of the <i><span lang="it">literati</span></i>,
prelates, courtiers, and wits of the town meet to order their
robes and dresses, report scandal, to anatomise reputations,
and kill their time. Pasquino’s humour was contagious,
and so many sharp epigrams were made in his shop that it
grew to be famous. After Pasquino’s death, in mending
the street, it became necessary to remove the old statue,
embedded in the ground near by; and to get it out of the
way it was set up at the side of his shop. The people then
in joke said that Pasquino had come back, and so the
statue acquired this nickname, which it has ever since
retained. This, at least, is the account given by Castelvetro,
published in 1553.... However this be, there is no
doubt that the custom soon grew up to stick to the statue
any lampoon, epigram, or satiric verses which the author
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>desired to be anonymous, and to pretend that it was a
<i><span lang="it">pasquinata</span></i>. From this time Pasquino becomes a name
and a power. His tongue could never be ruled. He had
his bitter saying on everything. Vainly Government strove
to suppress him. At one time he narrowly escaped being
thrown into the Tiber by Adrian VI., who was deeply
offended by some of his sarcasms; but he was saved from
this fate by the wisdom of the Spanish Legate, who gravely
counselled the Pope to do no such act, lest he should
thus teach all the frogs in the river to croak pasquinades.
In reference to the various attempts made to silence him,
he says in an epigram addressed to Paul III.—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Great were the sums once paid to poets for singing;</div>
      <div class='line'>How much will you, O Paul, give me to be silent?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Finally, his popularity became so great that all epigrams,
good or bad, were affixed to him. Against this he remonstrated,
crying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Alas! the veriest copyist sticks upon me his verses;</div>
      <div class='line'>Every one now on me his wretched trifles bestows.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This remonstrance seems to have been attended with good
results, for shortly after he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘No man at Rome is better than I; I seek nothing from any.</div>
      <div class='line'>I am never verbose; here I sit, and am silent.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Of late years no collection has been made, so far as I know,
of the sayings of Pasquin; and it is only here and there
that they can be found recorded in books or in the ‘hidden
tablets of the brain.’ But in 1544 a volume of 637 pages
was printed, with the title, <cite><span lang="it">Pasquillorum Tomi Duo</span></cite>, in
which, among a mass of epigrams and satires drawn from
various sources, a considerable number of real pasquinades
were preserved. This volume is now very rare and costly,
most of the copies having been burnt at Rome and elsewhere,
on account of the many satires it contained against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the Romish Church; so rare, indeed, that the celebrated
scholar Daniel Heinsius supposed his copy to be unique, as
he stated in the inscription written by him on its fly-leaf—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Rome to the fire gave my brothers—I, the single phœnix,</div>
      <div class='line'>Live—by Heinsius bought for a hundred pieces of gold.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In this, however, he was mistaken. There are several other
copies now known to be in existence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This collection was edited by Cælius Secundus Curio, a
Piedmontese, who, being a reformer, had suffered persecution,
confiscation, exile, and imprisonment in the Inquisition.
From the latter he escaped, and while spending his later
days in exile in Switzerland he printed this volume and sent
it forth to harass his enemies and bigoted opponents. The
chief aim of the book was to attack the Romish Church;
and some of the satires are evidently German, and probably
from the hands of his friends. It is greatly to be regretted
that no other collection exists; and since so great a success
has attended the admirable collections of popular songs and
proverbs in Tuscany, it is to be hoped that some competent
Italian may soon be found who will have the spirit and
patience to collect the pasquinades of more modern days.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The earliest pasquinades were directed against the Borgian
Pope, Alexander VI. (Sextus), the infamy of whose life
can scarcely be written. Of him says Pasquin—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘<span lang="la">Sextus Tarquinus, Sextus Nero—Sextus et iste;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Semper sub Sextis perdita Roma fuit.</span>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(Always under the Sextuses Rome has been ruined.)
Again, in allusion to the fact that he obtained his election
by the grossest bribery, and, as Guicciardini expresses it,
‘infected the whole world by selling without distinction
holy and profane things,’ Pasquino says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Alexander sells the keys, the altar, Christ:</div>
      <div class='line'>He who bought them first has a good right to sell.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Here, too, is another savage epigram on the Borgian Pope,
referring to the murder of his son, Giovanni, Duca di
Gandia. His brother, Cesare, Duca di Valentino, slew him
at night and threw his body into the Tiber, from which it
was fished out next morning—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Lest we should think you not a fisher of men, O Sextus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lo, for your very son with nets you fish!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“No epigrams worth recording seem to have been made
during the short reign of Pius III.; but Julius II., the warlike,
fiery, impetuous soldier drew upon himself the constant
fire of Pasquin. Alluding to the story that, when leading
his army out of Rome, he threw the keys of Peter into the
Tiber, saying that he would henceforth trust to the sword
of Paul, Pasquin, merely repeating his impetuous words,
says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Since nothing the keys of Peter for battle can profit,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sword of Paul, perhaps, may be of use.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And again, referring to the beard which Julius was the first
among the Popes of comparatively late days to wear—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The beard of Paul, and the sword of Paul—I would fain have all things of Paul—</div>
      <div class='line'>As for that key-bearer Peter, he’s not to my liking at all.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>But of all the epigrams on Julius none is so stern and fierce
as this—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Julius is at Rome—what is wanting? Ye gods, give us Brutus.</div>
      <div class='line'>For whenever at Rome is Julius, the city is lost!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“If to Julius Pasquin was severe, he was scathing to his
licentious and venal successor, Leo X., who raised money
for his vices by the sale of cardinals’ hats and indulgences.
Many of these epigrams are too coarse to bear translation;
here is one, however, more decent, if less bitter, than many—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“‘Bring me gifts, spectators! bring me not verses.</div>
      <div class='line'>Divine money alone rules the ethereal gods.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And again, referring to Leo’s taste for buffoons, he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Pasquin, why have you never asked to be made a buffoon?</div>
      <div class='line'>All things now are permitted at Rome to buffoons.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Here is another, referring to the story, current at Rome,
that Leo’s death was occasioned by poison, and on account
of its suddenness there was no time to administer to him
the last sacraments—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘At the last hour of life, if, perchance, you ask why Leo</div>
      <div class='line'>Could not the sacraments take—’tis plain he had sold them all!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“During the short reign of the ascetic Adrian VI. Pasquin
seems to have been comparatively silent, perhaps through
respect for that hard, bigoted, but honest Pope. Under his
successor, Clement VII., Rome was besieged, taken, and
sacked by the Constable de Bourbon, and through the
horrors of those days Pasquin’s voice was seldom heard.
One saying of his, however, has been preserved, which was
uttered during the period of the Pope’s imprisonment in the
Castle Saint Angelo. With a sneer at his infallibility and his
imprisonment, he says: ‘<span lang="it">Papa non potest errare</span>’—‘The
Pope cannot err (or go astray’)—<i><span lang="it">errare</span></i> having both
meanings. But if Pasquin spared the Pope during his life
he threw a handful of epigrams on his coffin at his death....
Thus in reference to the physician, Matteo Curzio, or Curtius,
to whose ignorance Clement’s death was attributed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Curtius has killed our Clement—let gold then be given</div>
      <div class='line'>To Curtius for thus securing the public health.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“On Paul III., the Farnese Pope, Pasquin exercised his
wit, but not always very successfully. This Pope was
celebrated for his nepotism, and for the unscrupulous ways
in which he endeavoured to build up his house and enrich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>his family, and one of Pasquin’s epigrams refers to this, as
well as to the well-known fact that he built his palace by
despoiling the Colosseum of its travertine—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Let us pray for Pope Paul, for his zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>For his house is eating him up.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“With Paul III. ceases the record of the <cite><span lang="it">Pasquillorum
Tomi Duo</span></cite>, published at Eleutheropolis in 1544, and we now
hunt out only rarely here and there an epigram. Against
Sextus V., that cruel, stern old man, who never lifted his
eyes from the ground until he had attained that great
reward for all his hypocritical humility, the papal chair,
several epigrams are recorded. One of these, in the form
of dialogue, and given by Leti in his life of Sextus, is worth
recording for the story connected with it. Pasquin makes
his appearance in a very dirty shirt, and being asked by
Marforio the reason of this, answers that he cannot procure
a clean shirt because his washerwoman has been made a
princess by the Pope; thus referring to the story that the
Pope’s sister had formerly been a laundress. This soon
came to the ears of the Pope, who ordered that the satirist
should be sought for and punished severely. All researches,
however, were vain. At last, by his order and in his name,
placards were posted in the public streets, promising, in case
the author would reveal his name, to grant him not only his
life, but a present of a thousand pistoles; but threatening,
in case of his discovery by any other person, to hang him
forthwith, and give the reward to the informer. The satirist
thereupon avowed the authorship and demanded the money.
Sextus, true to the letter of his proclamation, granted him
his life and paid him the one thousand pistoles; but in
utter violation of its spirit, and saying that he had not
promised absolution from all punishment, ordered his hands
to be struck off and his tongue to be bored, ‘to hinder him
from being so witty in future.’</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“But Pasquin was not silenced even by this cruel revenge,
and a short time after, in reference to the tyranny of Sextus,
appeared a caricature representing the Pope as King Stork
devouring the Romans as frogs, with the motto, ‘<i><span lang="it">Merito
haec patimur</span></i>,’ i.e. ‘<em>Serves us right.</em>’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Against Urban VIII., the Barberini Pope, whose noble
palace was built out of the quarry of the Colosseum, who
tore the bronze plates from the roof of the Pantheon, to
cast into the tasteless <i><span lang="it">baldacchino</span></i> of St. Peter’s, and under
whose pontificate so many antique buildings were destroyed,
Pasquin uttered the famous saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘What the barbarians have left undone, the Barberini have done.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“And on the occasion of Urban’s issuing a bull, excommunicating
all persons who took snuff in the churches at
Seville, Pasquin quoted from Job this passage, ‘Against a
leaf driven to and fro by the wind, wilt thou show thy
strength? and wilt thou pursue the light stubble?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ignorant, indolent, profligate Innocent X., with the
equally profligate Donna Olympia Maidalchini, afforded also
a target to Pasquin’s arrows. Of the Pope, he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Olympia he loves more than Olympus.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“During the reign of Innocent XI., the Holy Office
flourished, and its prisons were put in requisition for those
who dared to speak freely or to think freely. Pasquin, in
reference to this, says: ‘<span lang="it">Se parliamo, in galera; se scriviamo,
impiccati; se stiamo in quiete, al Santo Uffizio. Eh!—che
bisogna fare?</span>’ (If we speak, to the galleys; if we write, to
the gallows; if we keep quiet, to the Inquisition. Eh!—what
are we to do?)</p>

<p class='c009'>“Throughout Rome, the stranger is struck by the constant
recurrence of the inscription, ‘<span lang="it">Munificentia Pii Sexti</span>’ (By
the munificence of Pius VI.), on statues and monuments and
repaired ruins, and big and little antiquities. When, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>this Pope reduced the loaf of two <i><span lang="it">baiocchi</span></i> considerably
in size, one of them was found hung on Pasquin’s neck,
with the same inscription, ‘Munificentia Pii Sexti.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Against the despotism of this same Pope, when he was
building the great Braschi Palace, Pasquin wrote these
lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Three jaws had Cerberus, and three mouths as well,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which barked into the blackest deeps of hell.</div>
      <div class='line'>Three hungry mouths have you—ay! even four,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which bark at none, but every one devour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“During the French Revolution, and the occupation of

and among them this—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘<span lang="it">I Francesi son tutti ladri—</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(The French are all thieves—nay, not all, but <em>a good part</em>—or,
in the original, <em>Buonaparte</em>.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here also is one referring to the institution of the Cross
of the Legion of Honour in France, which is admirable in
wit—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘In times less pleasant and more fierce, of old,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“When the Emperor Francis of Austria visited Rome, Pasquin
called him ‘<span lang="la">Gaudium urbis—Fletus provinciorum—Risus
mundi</span>.’ (The joy of the city—the tears of the provinces—the
laughter of the world.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“A clever epigram was also made on Canova’s draped

<p>EPIGRAM ON CANOVA’S STATUE OF ITALY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“The latter days of Pius IX. have opened a large field for
Pasquin, and his epigrams have a flavour quite equal to that
of the best of which we have any record. When, in 1858,
the Pope made a journey through the provinces of Tuscany,
leaving the administration in the hands of Cardinal Antonelli
and other cardinals of the Sacred College, the following
dialogue was found on Pasquin:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘The Shepherd then is gone away?’</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘And whom has he left to take care of the flock?’</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘The dogs.’</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘And who keeps the dogs?’</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘The mastiff.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wit of Pasquin, as of all Romans, is never purely
verbal, for the pun, simply as a pun, is little relished in
Italy; ordinarily the wit lies in the thought and image,
though sometimes it is expressed by a play upon words as
well, as in the epigram on Buonaparte. The ingenious
method adopted by the Italians to express their political
sympathies with Victor Emmanuel was thoroughly characteristic
of Italian humour. Forbidden by the police to make
any public demonstration in his favour, the Government
were surprised by the constant shouts of ‘Viva Verdi!
Viva Verdi!’ at all the theatres, as well as by finding these
words scrawled on all the walls of the city. But they soon
discovered that the cries for Verdi were through no enthusiasm
for the composer, but only because his name was an
acrostic signifying</p>

    </div>

<p class='c009'>“Of a similar character was a satire in dialogue, which
appeared in 1859, when all the world at Rome was waiting
and hoping for the death of King Bomba, of execrated
memory. Pasquin imagines a traveller just returned from
Naples, and inquires of him what he has seen there—</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“‘<span lang="it">Ho visto un tumore.</span>’ (I have seen a tumour.)</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘E-eh! e-e-e-h!’</p>

<p class='c009'>with a shrug and a prolonged tone peculiarly Roman—indicative
of an immense doubt as to Paradise, and little
question as to the other place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two years ago Pasquin represents himself as having
joined the other plenipotentiaries at the conference of Zurich,
where he represents the Court of Rome. Austria speaks
German, France speaks French, neither of which languages
Pasquin understands. On being interrogated as to the
views of Rome, he answers that, being a priest, he only
speaks Latin, not Italian; and that, in his opinion, is ‘Sicut
erat in principio,’ etc. (As it was in the beginning, is now,
and ever shall be, world without end! Amen.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is as pure a specimen of true Roman wit as can be
found. Of a rather different and punning character was
the epigram lately made upon the movement of the
Piedmontese and Garibaldians on Naples and Sicily:
‘Tutti stanno in viaggio—soldati vanno per terra—marinari
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>vanno per mare, e preti vanno in aria.’ (Everybody is in
movement—the soldiers go by land, the sailors by sea, and
the priests vanish into air.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“And here too is another, full of spirit and point, which
shall be the last in these pages. When the conference
at Zurich was proposed, it was rumoured that Cardinal
Antonelli was to go as the representative of the Roman
States, and to be accompanied by Monsignor Barile, upon
which Pasquin said, ‘Il Cardinale di Stato va via con Barile,
ma tornerà con fiasco’—which is untranslatable.”<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>There are several collections of Pasquinades in the British
Museum, but none appear to extend over more than a single
year. None are later than 1536. The collection for that year
has the following MS. note (in English) on the fly-leaf: “The
Author of these Pasquinades is quite unknown. They have
little of the Petulance or Wit of that species of writing,
and consist principally of grave and fulsome Compliments to
the Emperor Charles 5th on his late Victories over the
Moors in Africa.” There is, however, a humorous prose
proclamation in Italian (the rest of the book is mostly in
Latin), “in order to enrich simple men who waste their time
in the practice of Alchemy.” To these persons he delivers
ten commandments, such as, “Always to have a pair of
bellows and keep it in its place, so that you may not have
to send and borrow from the neighbours—to know the
properties of metals—to use good earthenware—and to
employ an honest lad who will stick to his work and not
talk,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>About 1550 we find a curious little broadsheet entitled an
“opera,” but more like a street ballad—a kind of proclamation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>announcing that Pasquin has lost his nose, and is
making search for it. In the course of the next century
several prose works were issued under the name of Pasquin,
which were mostly dialogues between Pasquin and Marforio.
Many of them were translated into English, and appear to
have enjoyed a wide popularity towards the end of Charles
II.’s reign—which is not to be wondered at, if we remember
that this was the era of the Popish plot, and that Pasquin
is by no means sparing in his denunciations of the Roman
clergy. The <cite><span lang="it">Visione Politiche</span></cite> were printed in 1671, probably
at Geneva, and <cite>Pasquin risen from the Dead</cite> appeared
in London in 1674. This book must have been popular,
as at least one other translation was published. The version
of 1674—the translator’s name is not given—is quaint and
spirited; and the general tenor of the work may be gathered
from the following extract:—</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pasquin.</em> What, ho! Marforio! you’re in mighty haste,
sure; what, not so much as vouchsafe a word to an old
friend, but to pass by as though we had never seen one
another before?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Marforio.</em> God’s my life! what’s he that calls me? Sure
I have known that voice. It must certainly be Pasquin
that talks in that statue. And yet how can that be, since I
am a witness of his death? ’Tis surely some ghost that
would fain make me believe he is yet living. What would
I give for some holy water to drive this devil away now!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pasquin.</em> Prithee, sweetheart, been’t frighted; I am
Pasquin, very Pasquin, thy old pot-companion. Why
shouldst thou wish for holy water to drive me hence, since
I am miraculously risen?... And prithee, by the way, be
no longer cheated with that fond opinion that holy water is
able to drive away devils. Those are old wives’ fables, fit
only to bubble fools withal; for, were there any such thing,
since there can be no worse devil than the priests and
friars, they had been all driven out of the church long ago.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span><em>Marforio.</em> Where the devil hadst thou this knowledge?
Sure, thou hast not been in hell to fetch it? I am almost
in an ague to think of it, and the more I look on thee the
more I tremble.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pasquin.</em> Been’t such a fool to be afraid to look upon a
friend, for true friendship should last even to the other
world: but I am no ghost or goblin, but verily alive; or
were I dead (as indeed I have been), what reason hast thou
to fear me? The dead are honest, quiet people: they
neither kill nor steal; they ramble not about the streets in
the night to murder poor tailors; they break no glass
windows, nor beat no watches, nor are any violators of the
laws. Whilst I was in the world I was never afraid of the
dead. If I could but guard myself from the living, who are
a proud, revengeful generation, that scarce pardon men in
their graves, I thought all well enough; therefore, prithee,
be of my mind.... Take my counsel, keep as fair as thou
canst with the living, and leave the dead to their fate.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Marforio.</em> Yet at least let me have commune with thee,
that com’st to seek mine with so much grace and civility.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pasquin.</em> I am alive and not dead, for my death was
rather a wonderful ecstasy than anything else.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Marforio.</em> But tell me, prithee, how is it possible that
thou, who art a body of stone, as thou art, couldst first be
animated, then die, and be revived again?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pasquin.</em> And canst thou that art born a Roman be such
a noddy as to wonder at that—thou that seest daily so many
greater wonders before thy eyes? With how much more
reason mayst thou wonder to see so many tun-bellied friars
(the good always excepted) that feed like pigs and drink
like fishes; that fatten themselves in the scoundrel laziness
of the convents, and yet have the impudence to think they
shall one day enjoy the felicities of Paradise? And yet
greater wonders than this there are. For thou knowest, or
at least shouldst know, that all divines agree that there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>nothing in the world that can be equal in weight to the
nature of sin; for, say they, iron, lead, stones, brass, or
gold are, in comparison, lighter than feathers when put in
the scale with sin. So that he must needs be worse than a
sot that believes that so many bouncing friars, as well
seculars as regulars, who are laden with such a mass of sins
that only to lift one of them from the ground would require
an engine like that wherewith Sixtus V. raised the great
Pyramid of St. Peter,<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a> can ever mount up to heaven....
This, brother, must needs be so great a folly that any man
of reason cannot but imagine it a less wonder to see a stone
mount up to heaven than one of those sinful monks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pasquin then describes his journey through the Unseen
World, which is made the vehicle for a great deal of strong
invective against the Pope and Clergy. No Pope, he says,
has ever entered heaven since the year 800, “that is, soon
after corruption was crept into the Pontificate;” and the
infernal regions are peopled with the various religious orders.
Pasquin sought in vain among them for the Jesuits—but
only because a separate and special place of torment was
reserved for the latter.</p>

for the very same reason for which I imagined you had
bought it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tesetto was very angry with Zerbo the physician, when
Zerbo saying to him, “Hold your tongue, you scoundrel;
don’t I know that your father was a bricklayer?” Tesetto
immediately replied, “No one could have told you that but
your own father, who carried the lime and the stones to mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A criminal being carried to prison, and hearing his process

<p class='c008'>A certain person, who was desirous to be thought young,

<p class='c008'>A thief going with a trunk full of valuable things from a
citizen’s house in the dusk of the evening, was met by some
persons who asked him how he came by them. The thief
replied, “A man is dead in this house, and I am carrying
this trunk, with other things, to another house where I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>going to live.” “But if that man be lately dead,” said they,
“why don’t they weep and take on?” “You’ll hear them
weep to-morrow morning,” says the thief.</p>

<p class='c008'>A physician, who had a son of his under cure, gave him
no remedy, and prescribed nothing, but only that he should
observe a regular course of diet. His daughter-in-law complained,

sick people; and the physician replied, “Daughter, we
physicians have medicaments in order to sell them, and not
to make use of them ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A certain lazzarone once came to confess himself to a
missionary priest who was confined to his bed with the
gout, with the intention of stealing a pair of new shoes
which he had seen under the good father’s bed. The priest
having called him up to the bed, as he could not rise, the
man knelt down, and while reciting the <cite><span lang="it">Confiteor</span></cite> got
hold of the shoes, and put them into the wallet which he
had under his cloak. Having finished the <cite><span lang="it">Confiteor</span></cite>, the
first and last sin which he confessed was that of having
stolen a pair of shoes. The confessor replied, “Ah! my
son, you ought to restore them!” The penitent replied,
“Father, do you want them?” “No,” said the priest, “no,
my son; but they ought to be restored to the rightful owner,
otherwise I cannot give you absolution.” “But, father,”
replied the man, “the owner says he does not want them;
what, then, shall I do?” The confessor answered, “Since
that is so, keep them for yourself,” and giving him absolution,
he dismissed him, and the penitent carried off the
shoes.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Dante, meditating apart one day in the church of Santa
Maria Novella, was accosted by a bore, who asked him
many foolish questions. After vainly endeavouring to get
rid of him, Dante at last said, “Before I reply to thee do
thou tell me the answer to a certain question,” and then
asked him, “<em>Which is the greatest of all beasts?</em>” The
gentleman replied that “on the authority of Pliny he believed
it to be the elephant.” Then said Dante, “O elephant,
leave me in peace!” and so saying, he turned and left
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Domenico da Cigoli having gone to Rome, news was
brought him a few days after that his wife was dead; upon
which he, in the utmost transports of joy, immediately
became priest and undertook the cure of souls in his own
village, when who should be the very first person that he
meets but his wife, who was not dead but living, which
greatly afflicted him.</p>

<p class='c008'>A certain rich man had a son who had but little sense,
and wishing to get him a wife, found a fair and gentle damsel;
and her parents being willing to overlook the defects of the
man for the sake of his riches, the marriage was concluded.
Then the father, in order to hide as much as he could the
imbecile foolishness of his son, admonished him to speak
little, that his folly and light-mindedness might not be made
manifest. The son obeyed; and when they were seated at
the wedding-feast it happened that not only he but all the
others kept silence, till at last a lady of more courage than
the rest said, looking round at the guests, “Surely there
must be a fool at this table, since no one ventures to speak!”
Then said the bridegroom, turning to his father, “Father,
now that they have found me out, pray give me permission
to talk!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>A countryman, benumbed with cold, alighted from his
horse to walk on foot, and two Franciscan friars observing
this, one of them said to his companion, “Had I a horse I
would not be such a fool as to lead him by the bridle, but
would make use of him to carry me to the convent.” Says
the other, who was of a gay temper, “I would play this
countryman a trick, and steal his horse from him, if you
would but help me.” The friar immediately consenting,
both of them stole very softly up to the countryman,
without his perceiving it; and one, slyly taking the bridle
off the horse, put it over his own head, while the other
with a halter led the horse aside. Not long after this
the countryman, intending to get on horseback again,
turned himself about, but had like to have died with
fear when he saw the change; and, uttering terrible cries
for help, he was stopped by the Franciscan, who went down
on his knees before him, and begged him very humbly to
give him his liberty, telling him that he had been condemned
to such a metamorphosis because of his irregularities, and the
enormities of his sins; and that the time of his penance
being expired, he was returned to his first shape. The
peasant, recovering himself a little, not only let him go,
but also, not smelling the trick in the least, foolishly
replied, “Get you gone in Heaven’s name; I now no longer
wonder if, after having led so disorderly a life, you should
have been changed into so vile an animal.” The friar, telling
him that he was greatly obliged to him, made off, and went
to look after his companion, and when they saw the poor
silly fellow at a good distance, went another way to a
neighbouring town. A few days after, the Franciscans
desired a friend of theirs to go and sell the horse at the
fair. This man sold the horse, and as he was going with
the buyer to receive the money for it, whom should they
happen to meet but the countryman, who, knowing the
horse again, desired the buyer to let him speak a word with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>him in private; and having asked him whom the horse
belonged to, the other replied that he had just bargained
for it, but had not yet paid for it. “For goodness’ sake,”
said the countryman, “return it to him again; don’t pay
for it, for I assure you that ’tis not a horse, but the soul of
a cordelier, who is returned to his dissolute way of life.
Don’t buy him, I tell you, for he’s the most wretched
animal in the whole world, and has put me into a fury an
hundred thousand times.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>How Piovano Arlotto got his Place by the Fire.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>Piovano Arlotto, returning from Casentino one Sunday
evening, worn out and wet through (for it was raining
heavily), dismounted before the inn at Pontassieve and
went in, to dry himself at the fire. But, as it happened,
there were over thirty villagers present, drinking and playing
cards, and they were crowded so closely about the fire
that he could not get near it, nor would they make room
for him, though he asked them. At last, mine host, who
knew him for a fellow of infinite jest, said to him, “Sir
priest, why are ye so sad this evening, quite contrary to
your nature? If there be aught troubling ye, tell us, for
there is nothing we would not do for ye.” The priest said,
“I am in evil case, for I have lost, from this wallet, fourteen
<i><span lang="it">lire</span></i> of small change, and eighteen gold florins. Yet
I have hope of finding them again; for I think ’tis but
within the last five miles I dropped them, and the weather
is so bad, there is none will travel that road after me to-night.
And if ye will do me a service, then, to-morrow morning if
it rain not, do thou come, or send a man back along the
road with me to find it.” Scarcely had the priest finished
speaking, when those countrymen went out softly, by twos
and fours, so that at the last there was none left, and went
back along the road in the rain, hoping to find the money,
leaving the priest to take the best place by the fire.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Fagiuoli and the Thieves.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>One evening Fagiuoli was going home, and when he came
to his door he saw some men bringing out his furniture, for
they were thieves who were stealing his things. He said
nothing, but remained quiet, wishing to see where they would
take the things. When they had brought them all down, they
put them on barrows and took them away, Fagiuoli walking
after them. When the thieves saw a gentleman following
them, they stopped and asked him what he wanted. Then
he answered, “I am coming to see where I am going to live,
as you have moved my furniture.” Then the thieves threw
themselves down on their knees, and carried back his things;
but he did not bring the matter before the magistrates.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Three Words.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>There was once a husband and wife, and they had three
sons who did not know how to talk. The time came when
their parents died, and, when they were both dead, the eldest
boy said, “Do you know what I have thought of? We will
go and travel about the world, and so we shall hear people
talk, and learn to talk ourselves.” So they set out, and they
came to three roads. “Let us each go a different way, and
the first who has learnt anything come back here; and then
we will seek service with some one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The eldest took the middle road, and came to a churchyard,
and as he passed it he saw two men talking together.
He came up with them and heard one of them say “<em>Yes</em>.”
“Ah! I have learnt enough—I have learnt to talk; now
I will go back!” He went back to the place where the
roads met and found no one there. There was an inn near
by, and he went in to have something to eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second brother went on till he came to two peasants
carrying a bundle of hay, who were talking. He listened
to them, and heard one say, “<em>It is true</em>.” “I have learnt
enough—I will go back;” and he went back to the cross-roads
as his brother had done.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>The youngest went on till evening, when he saw a herd-lassie
getting her sheep together, and heard her say, “<em>That’s
right.</em>” “I’ve learnt enough,” he said; “I’m going back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He came to the cross-roads, and found his brothers there.
“What have you learnt?” “I know <em>Yes</em>.” “And you?”
“<em>It is true.</em> And you?” “<em>That’s right.</em>” “Now we can
go to the king’s palace to take service, now that we know
these words.” So they all three started by the same road.
When they had gone some distance they found a dog-kennel,
got into it all three, and slept soundly. At midnight the
dog wanted to go to bed,—he barked and barked, but they
would not let him in, so that he had to sleep outside.
“See,” said they, “to-night we have a dog to guard us, like
other people, but to-morrow morning we shall have to go
away quietly, without waking him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They got up in the morning, but the dog was asleep,
and did them no harm. Further on along the road they
found a dead man. “Look at this poor man!—he ought
to be taken into the city—we must let the police know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of them went on to the city, and gave notice, and
the police came out. “Who killed him? Did you do it?”
The eldest answered “<em>Yes</em>,” for he could say nothing else;
and the second said, “<em>It is true</em>.” “Then you will have
to come to prison.” And the youngest said, “<em>That’s
right</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they seized them, and took them away to the town
along with the dead man. In the town all the people cried
out, “They ought to be torn to pieces! They have said it
themselves! the villains!” And they could answer nothing
but <em>Yes</em>, <em>It is true</em>, and <em>That’s right</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, after asking them a great many questions, and getting
nothing else out of them, they put them in prison; and after
they had kept them there some time, they let them go,
because they found out that they were only fools. So the
three brothers went home again.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>One day Giucca’s
mother said to him,
“I want this cloth sold,
but if I let you take it
to the market you will
be at your old tricks
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, mother; you
shall see I will do it
all right. Tell me how
much you want for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten crowns; and
mind you sell it to a
person who does not
talk much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Giucca took the
cloth, and went away.
He met a peasant, who
said to him, “Giucca,
are you going to sell
this cloth? How much
do you want for it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten crowns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, that is too
much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, look here—I
can’t let you have it
at all, because you talk
too much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, do you want
to sell your goods
without people’s saying
anything?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“Oh! I can’t let you have it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Giucca went on. When he had gone a little further, he
came to a statue of plaster of Paris.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! good woman, do you want to buy some cloth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The statue said nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Said Giucca: “This is just right. Mother told me to
sell the cloth to some one who does not talk. I couldn’t do
better than this. I say, good woman! I want ten crowns
for it”—and he threw the cloth at her; “to-morrow I will
come and fetch them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he went home, well pleased. His mother said,
“Giucca, have you sold the cloth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Giucca; “they told me I was to come and
fetch the money to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But tell me—did you give it to a trustworthy
person?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so. She was a good sort of woman, you may
believe that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us leave Giucca, and go back to the statue, which was
hollow, and was the place where some robbers hid their
money. In the evening they came with some more money
to put away inside the image.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look,” they said, “some one has left this cloth; let
us keep it.” They hid the money and carried off the
cloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the morning, when Giucca got up, he said, “Mother,
I am going to fetch that money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good; be quick about it, and mind they give you
the whole of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Giucca went to the statue. “Hallo, mistress, I’ve come
for the money!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The statue said nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! look here! It must not be the same as yesterday;
to-day I want the money. I see you have used the cloth.
Give me the money, or let me have the cloth back.”</p>

<img src='images/i_298.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So he picked up a stone and threw it at her. And
then the statue was broken, and all the money began
to fall out. Giucca was well pleased; he picked up
the money and went home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look, mother, how much money I have brought
you! I told you she was a good sort of woman.
First she did not want to give it me, but then I
threw stones at her, and
she gave me all this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But tell me,
Giucca, what have
you done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, don’t you
know her?—the
creature who has been
standing there bolt upright
for ever so long!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you rascal! what have you done? Dear me!
dear me! With all this money I had better find you a wife
to look after you!”</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Hermit and the Thieves.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>... Once, she said, there was a hermit, a poor sort of
priest, who lived all alone, and had no society but his pig,
with whom he used to eat at the same table as a sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>penance for his sins. Besides the pig he had a box of
money, which he had collected in little sums given in
charity till it amounted to a good large sum, and this he
kept hidden away under his bed. Now it happened that there
were two bad men, two robbers, who heard of this box, and
desired very much to get possession of it. So they put
their heads together to construct a plan to deceive the poor
old hermit. At last they hit upon one, and it was this:
Having first got a good strong rope and a large basket, they
went one night to his house, and climbed upon the roof
without his knowledge, and let down the basket until it
hung before the sill of his window. Both of them then
began to sing—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Arise, arise, O hermit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And come up in the basket, O;</div>
      <div class='line'>The saints in glory ask it, O,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Waiting in Paradise!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The poor hermit, hearing these words, thought that the
angels had come from heaven to bring him his reward. So
up he jumped and opened the window, and when he saw
the basket his joy was very great at the expectation of going
in it up to Paradise. So after crossing himself devoutly, in
he jumped, murmuring—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lord, Lord! I am not so good</div>
      <div class='line'>That I should get into a basket of wood.”<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Up the robbers then pulled him, until he was half-way to
the roof, and then, fastening the rope round the chimney,
down they ran, got into his room, plundered him of his
money-box, and made off with themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime for a long space the hermit hung there, waiting
and wondering why he had stopped, and praying with shut
eyes; but at last he grew impatient, for he did not go up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and the voices had ceased, and he wriggled about so much
that the rope broke, and down he came to the ground, not
without some severe bruises. But what was his indignation
upon dragging himself up to his room to find his money-box
gone, and only the pig remaining! However, he put the
best face on it, said “<em>Pazienza!</em>” and prayed still more
earnestly. Now the same two robbers, after having got
possession of the box, began to think that they had been
very great fools not to have taken the pig too, which they
could sell at a good price at the fair. So they determined
to try the same trick again in order to get the pig. Up
they got therefore on the roof, and let down the basket as
before, singing the same song, “<em>Arise, O hermit</em>,” etc. But
this time the hermit was not to be taken in; and he
answered to the robbers, whom he still thought to be
angels, in verse which may thus be Englished—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Go back, you blessed Angels,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And let the good saints know</div>
      <div class='line'>That once they’ve come it over me,</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A certain aged lady was
desirous of eating figs,
and went out into her garden,
intending to knock down a few
with a long pole; but finding
herself unable to do this, in
spite of her infirmities she began
climbing the tree to pick them,
and did not even take off her
slippers. At this juncture the
Devil, in human shape, happened
to pass by, and thinking
that the old lady was about to
fall, said to her, “My good
woman, if you wish to climb a

at least remove your slippers,
otherwise you will most assuredly
fall and break your bones.” To
this the old lady replied angrily,
“My good sir, it does not

the tree with slippers or without
them; pray go about your business,
that I may not say, to
perdition!” So she went on
climbing; but just as she was
about to seize the branch on
which the figs were, one of her
slippers came off, and she fell to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>the ground. Lying on the ground, she began to scream;
and when her family came to see what was the matter she
would say nothing but “The Devil blinded me!—the
Devil blinded me!” The Devil, who was not far off,
went up to her, and hearing what she said, found it more
than he could stand, and really blinded both her eyes,
saying, “I warned you, and asked you not to climb the tree
in slippers, telling you that you would fall, and in return
for that you gave me a very rude answer. And now,
instead of saying, ‘If I had listened to that wayfarer I
should not have fallen,’ you say ‘The Devil blinded me;’
and I, who am really the Devil, have blinded you in very
truth. What’s the good of blaming the cat when the
mistress is mad?” So saying, the Devil vanished away,
and the obstinate old woman was left without her eyesight.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A certain man of
Celento having come
to Naples to attend to a law-suit,
was forced to take a
house; and in order to be
near the Vicaria,<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> he took
one close to the Convent of
San Giovanni a Carbonara.
In this house he found an
old picture hanging on the
wall, all black and grimed
with smoke, to which, thinking
it to represent some
saint, he recommended himself
most fervently every
time he left the house, praying
that he might be preserved
from every misfortune,
find a good lawyer, and gain
his case. The first time he
said his prayers before this
picture, on returning home
at night, he was attacked
and beaten by thieves. On
the next day he fell down
the stairs and bruised himself
all over; and on the
third he was arrested and
imprisoned for a theft which
had been committed near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>his lodging. On coming out of prison he once more
addressed his prayers to the unknown image for a good
lawyer; but this petition, too, was granted the wrong way,
for he fell into the hands of one who was the greatest
scoundrel and blunderer that could be imagined. The
poor Celentano, quite broken down by his troubles,
redoubled his prayers to the smoky picture in hopes of
at least gaining his law-suit; but after this last attempt,
seeing that things were going from bad to worse, he came
home, no longer able to contain himself. “Now,” he said,
“I want to see what the picture is which has gained me so
many benefits from Heaven, and worked so many miracles
in my favour.” He therefore took it down from the wall,
and, after having carefully cleaned it, perceived that it
represented a lawyer in his robes. Whereat he cried,
“Ah! thou accursed race! none other could have worked
such miracles! A fine saint I had chosen as my protector!”
And therewith he cut the picture in pieces and threw it
into the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>A peasant of Chiaramonte,<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> returning home by moonlight,
on his ass, with two panniers of fresh-plucked grapes,
passed by a cypress-tree, on which an owl was sitting. The
owl began to hoot and moan in so piteous a manner that it
seemed as though he would moan out his very heart. Poor
Vito (every Chiaramonte man is called Vito) was a fool,
but he had a kind heart, and he was saddened by the
moaning of the owl, thinking that perhaps he was hungry.
So, overcome by compassion, he called out, “Owl of mine,
dost thou want a bunch of grapes?” The owl went on
hooting “<i><span lang="co">Cciù</span></i>.”<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> “How? Is one bunch not enough?—dost

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>During the recent elections there was a large popular
demonstration at Bergamo, where the police mustered
in great force to prevent a disturbance. A fiery-spirited
youth, seeing a gentleman escorted by two policemen, made
a sudden rush to deliver him from his captors. In vain the
supposed victim protested that his generous interposition
was quite uncalled for.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! Signore, I could not for a moment think of leaving
you in the hands of these minions of injustice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, sir, moderate yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Moderate myself? We are not Moderates; we are

alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a bit of it; come on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the young fellow dragged the gentleman along in
spite of his protests. At last, in order to escape from his
inexorable liberator, he was compelled to inform him that he
was Rizzi, the superintendent of police himself. Our young
hero was let off with a gentle admonition.—<cite>Fanfulla.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>A gentleman and his valet had been out to a party,
where both of them indulged a little too freely. On returning
home the valet got into his master’s bed, mistaking it for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>his own, and the master, not knowing what he did, lay down
with his feet on the pillow and his head to the foot of the
bed (in the same bed). In the middle of the night one of
them began to kick and awoke the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Signor Padrone!” exclaimed the valet, “there’s a scamp
of a robber hiding in my bed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t say so!” replied his master; “in that case
there must be a pair of them, for I have got one here in my
bed. You try and get rid of yours; I’ll make short work
with mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And seizing each other by the feet they rolled out of bed
and alighted on the floor, where they fell asleep again, and
did not discover the true state of affairs till they awoke the
next morning.—<cite><span lang="it">Gazzetta di Malta.</span></cite></p>

<p class='c008'>Alberto Gelsomini has joined an amateur dramatic
society. On the night of his first appearance in public he
had only a small part assigned to him. All he had to say
was—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Signore, a gentleman of about fifty years has been some
time in the anteroom; shall I show him in?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Instead of which Gelsomini blurted out, excitedly—</p>

<p class='c008'>A young dramatic author took a play to the manager of a

<p class='c008'>A physician, already advanced in years, was asked what

<p class='c009'>Taking his courage in both hands, and laying it before

uncle—the well-known avarice of his father precluding, all
hope of assistance from <em>him</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was his letter:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Uncle</span>,—If you could see how I blush, with
shame while I am writing, you would pity me. Do you
know why?... Because I have to ask you for a hundred

No! it is impossible for me to tell you; I prefer to

may get lost!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The uncle was naturally touched; he considered the

<p class='c008'>A book-collector has just purchased, at an exorbitant

<p class='c009'>“It is very dear,” said a friend to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but it is the only copy in existence.”</p>

but Parini would say nothing but “Print the other!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Spippoletti’s son having reached an age when the heart
is susceptible, fell in love with a pretty little milliner, and
wrote to her declaring his eternal devotion. After filling
four pages with passionate adjurations and orthographical
mistakes, he concluded thus—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope that my offers will be acceptable to you, and
expect from you shortly an <em>affirmative</em> reply, <em>in which you

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>The mother of a seminary student sent her son a new

<p class='c008'>At a <i><span lang="fr">café</span></i> some one asked, “Excuse me, sir; does the

<p class='c009'>The grave man thus interrogated replied, in a solemn and
professional manner, not without a sting of bitter irony:
“Of course, sir. You might have seen that by the very title
of the paper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, sir, on your principle the <cite>Century</cite> should only
appear once every hundred years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Collapse of the grave man.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other day Spippoletti received an anonymous post-card
which informed him that he was an old imbecile.
Thinking that he recognised the writing of a facetious
friend, he hastened at once to the latter and asked him—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was it you that sent me this infamous libel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” replied the other very calmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who could it be, then?” demanded Spippoletti.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, my dear fellow, I am not the only man who knows
you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Spippoletti’s wife, not having much confidence in the
abilities of her servant, has been going to market herself.
One day, approaching the fishwife’s stall; she asked the price
of a large carp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Six francs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lady examined the fish, and exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not fresh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you it is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it’s quite flabby.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“Oh! go on insulting it!” replied the fishwife bitterly.
“It can’t answer you!”</p>

Signora Spippoletti bought the fish to make up for the
injury to its feelings.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A. to B.</em> The intelligence of animals is something extraordinary.
For example, my dog Fido is a wonderfully clever

<p class='c009'><em>B.</em> Well, I have seen stranger things than that in India.
I knew an old elephant to whom they used to give orders
for the next day’s purchases every evening; and as his

always tied a knot in his trunk, so that he might be sure not
to forget.</p>

<p class='c008'>The celebrated mathematician Plana, in examining

half of eight?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The youth at first looked inclined to be offended, but
speedily recovered his composure, and replied coolly,
“Five!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Baron Plana, cooler still, said, “Prove it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Easily, sir,” replied the student. “If you take one

<p class='c008'>There are some people with a mania for suicide, and
others with one for saving life. Within the last few days
a mason at Rovigo threw himself under the wheels of a
carriage. Death was imminent, when Ranchetti—this is
the name of our rescuer—sprang in front of the horses, and
saved the unfortunate workman at the risk of his own life.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mason hastened home, shut the door of his house,
and quietly hanged himself. But he had reckoned without
his unknown rescuer. Ranchetti, foreseeing some fatal
design, followed him, got into the room by breaking a
window, cut the rope, called for help, and saved the
would-be suicide a second time.</p>

<p class='c009'>If this sort of thing goes on Ranchetti will have plenty
to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>A certain lawyer, in consequence of various political

<p class='c008'>A soldier in the Naples militia asked his captain for
permission to go out for half-an-hour, which was refused.
Somewhat later he renewed his request with the same result;
and, after waiting some time, made a third application—still
to no purpose. At last, at the fourth time of asking,
permission was granted; the soldier went away, and was
seen no more for two hours.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>“How is this?” said the captain on his return. “You

<p class='c008'>As a diligence was passing along a part of the road
reputed dangerous, some of the passengers expressed their
fear of being attacked by robbers. “Do not be afraid,”
said an Englishman, who was one of them; “I have foreseen
everything—I have two loaded pistols at the bottom of my

<p class='c008'>A Neapolitan, paying a visit to Milan, said to a countryman

<p class='c008'>So-and-so, who is in mourning for his mother, was one

mother is not dead—why should she go into black?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A young man of these days, whose reputation is none
of the best, was boasting in company of his skill as a
physiognomist. “I have a thorough knowledge of rascals,”

understand them, at first sight.” Hearing this, a respectable
man, who was acquainted with him, said, “Did you
ever look in the glass?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A Knight Commander of Malta, who was exceedingly
avaricious, had two pages, who one day complained to him
that they had no shirts to wear. The miser called his

my estates in Sicily, and tell him to have some hemp sown
at once. When the hemp is gathered, he is to have it
spun, and then woven into cloth, to make shirts for these
young men.” At this the pages laughed. “Ah! the
rogues!” said the knight; “see how delighted they are,
now that they have their shirts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A gentleman of Naples fought fourteen duels in order

<p class='c008'>An actor, asking the manager for his arrears of payment,
told him that he was in danger of dying of starvation. The
manager, looking at his plump and ruddy countenance, told
him that his face did not bear out the assertion. “Don’t
let yourself be misled by that,” said the actor; “this face is
not mine; it belongs to my landlady, who has been letting
me live on credit for the last six months!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gennaro, of Naples, said one day to a friend, “I receive

When <em>I</em> lower myself so far as to write anonymous letters, I
always sign them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Francesco Gallina, the lawyer, was disputing a point
with his colleague, Giacomo Sanciotti. Being unable to
support his reasoning, he improvised a law which justified
the position he took. Sanciotti, perceiving this stratagem,
immediately invented another which put Gallina in the
wrong. The latter, never having heard of such a law, said,
“Can you give me the reference?” “You will find it,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>replied Sanciotti, without hesitating, “on the same page as
the Act you have just quoted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A countryman attending church at a distance from his
own village, was observed to sit unmoved through a sermon

newspaper the following advertisement:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Red Noses.</span>—Instant cure. Apply, enclosing P.O. for
two francs, to Signor Dulcamara.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>A worthy citizen, whose nose was “ruddier than the
cherry,” hoping to get rid of his affliction, immediately sent
in his address and the two francs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two days later he received a post-card—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on drinking till your nose turns blue!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“John, take this cup away; the beef-tea is cold!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cold? sir; oh, no! that’s just a fancy of yours, sir; it’s
quite hot still, for I tried it, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! You dared to taste——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh no, sir; I only dipped my finger into it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>At the Police Court.—<em>President</em>: “What! you here
again? You are perfectly incorrigible. You see, now, what
bad company leads to.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Prisoner</em>: “Oh! sir, how can you say that? Why, I
never see any one but policemen and magistrates.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A parvenu, in giving an invitation to dinner to a celebrated
violinist who had just given a concert at the house
of a banker, said to him, with pretended carelessness—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! by-the-bye—you will bring your violin, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” replied the artist, “but my violin never
dines out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An old and knowing lawyer in the provinces, while
waiting for the court to open, fell into conversation with
another lawyer, equally old and knowing, who said to him—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who can that Fra Diavolo<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> be whose name occurs so
often under the heading, ‘The Milan theatres’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” replied the first, with perfect seriousness, “he was
a Terracina lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A provincial householder returned from a shooting
expedition in the marshes, wet to the skin. Entering the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>house, he called out, with chattering teeth, to his wife, “Get
the fire lit at once!” The latter, after going to the window
and looking at the neighbours’ chimneys, replied—“No,
indeed!—No one else has a fire lit, and I do not wish to
make myself the subject of remark!”</p>

<p class='c008'>During dinner, at the Castle, the tutor was being
questioned about the progress made by the heir-presumptive
to the coronet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just now we are working at natural science. Our noble
pupil is making rapid progress in chemistry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he learning about dynamite?” asked the Marchioness
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet, madam;—dynamite comes under the head of
political economy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At a Charity Concert.—(<em>The pianist is playing horribly
out of tune.</em>)—“What is that brute doing? I understand
that it is a charity concert, but—all the same—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, that is just the reason he does not let his left
hand know what his right is doing!”</p>

<p class='c008'>At the Manœuvres.—<em>Captain</em>: I want all the corporals,
without exception, to give the word of command together,
and distinctly.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment after there is a general and vigorous shout of
“Shoulder arms!”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Captain</em> (<em>furiously</em>). I <em>hear</em> several corporals saying nothing
at all!</p>

<p class='c009'>This must be the same officer who said, the other day—“In
Company B, I see a man who is not there!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” said the tenor, “I have sung in all the
operas, and have always taken the principal parts—in <cite><span lang="it">Robert

<p class='c008'>What is a Secret Society?</p>

<p class='c009'>A Secret Society is a greater or less number of individuals
who meet from time to time in the most secret way possible,
in order to shout their secrets in each other’s ears at the top
of their voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>Force of Habit.—A well-known artist suffers horribly
from corns on his feet. His toes, moreover, are deplorably
sensitive, so that he calls out if they are scarcely touched.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has gone so far that, when he steps on his own boots,
which he has put out to be cleaned, he imagines that his
feet are inside, and yells like one possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah-h-h!—body of a rhinoceros!!—look out! Where
are you going?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A pretended pilgrim, tramping about the country, sells
little pieces of stuff, which, according to him, once formed
part of the cloak of St. Martin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are they good for?” asked a rustic, one day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They will keep out the cold,” replied the pilgrim, and
salved his conscience by adding, aside—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Taken in large quantities.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At a country inn an English traveller ordered hare for
dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give him some hare,” said the landlady to her husband,
without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know we have none,” replied he, in an undertone.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wife answered, quite undisturbed—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give him some rabbit then. He’s an Englishman—he’ll
never know the difference.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>A clever man, who suffers from absence of mind, said to
a friend—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!—So-and-so?—He died in September, and I have
not seen him since!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is said that a rich Frenchman who was insane came to
Milan, and after two days recovered his reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some people may think this surprising. We do not.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is quite natural that, in a city where so many lose their
wits, one man should find some.</p>

<p class='c008'>A telegram received from Lisbon informs us that “a terrible
cyclone has completely destroyed Manilla.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A few hours later another despatch arrived—“The cholera
has entirely ceased in Manilla.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We have no hesitation in believing it. Surely, if Manilla
no longer exists, everything, the cholera included, must have
ceased there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Filippo made a valuable confession the other day. Talking
of marionettes, he said, “I must acknowledge I have a
great liking for this kind of spectacle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bravo, Filippo! Family affection is a sacred thing!</p>

<p class='c008'>Some time ago the Government came to the decision of
having the <cite>Official Gazette</cite> printed by convicts, in order, it
is said, not to introduce an alien element.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now that the secret has transpired, the resolution has
been rescinded, and the convicts will no longer do the
printing.</p>

<p class='c009'>This second resolution has been explained by saying that
the Government wishes to give no cause for accusations of
family favouritism. We are quite willing to accept both
excuses.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>In the Naples police court a witness was once asked where

</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Note 1</span>, p. <a href='#Page_48'>48</a>.—This line is printed in the edition of 1825 (I am not
aware whether there is any other) as “An old stony Giggiano,”
which does not make sense, as there appears to be no such word as
“Giggiano” in Italian, except a proper name, applied to a district in
Tuscany. The emendation I have ventured upon gives the sense
correctly. The literal translation of the last six lines is—“Or of that
which, vermillion and brilliant, makes proud the Aretine who grows it
on Tregonzano, and amid the stones of Giggiano.” Leigh Hunt seems
to have sent the MS. of his translation from Florence, in January
1825, to London, where it was published for him by his brother; so
that it is probable the proofs were not revised by the author.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Note 2</span>, p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>.—Professor Th. Trede, in his recently published work,
<cite><span lang="de">Das Heidentum in der römischen Kirche</span></cite>, says that Modica, in the south
of Sicily, is divided into two rival camps, devoted respectively to the
worship of St. Peter and St. George. The festivals of these two saints
give rise to scenes more suggestive of Donnybrook Fair than anything
else. Similar conflicts between rival cities are by no means rare in the
Neapolitan territory. (Trede, <em>op. cit.</em>, ii. 260.)</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Note 3</span>, p. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>.—“In the south of Italy, the birth of a girl is by no
means considered a particularly joyful event. The birth of a boy is
followed by rejoicings and festivities—no notice is taken of a girl. Of
the thousands of infants annually received into the Naples foundling
hospital, the boys only remain there a short time. They are soon
adopted by families who have lost a child, but it is very seldom that
any one thinks of taking a girl from the hospital. In Santa Lucia,
when a boy is born, the whole quarter is thrown into the greatest
excitement; he is handed round to all the <i><span lang="it">comari</span></i>, friends and neighbours—kissed,
squeezed, pinched, out of sheer love and delight. But
a girl-baby lies unnoticed in the clothes-basket, which serves as a
cradle, and is neither kissed nor admired. At baptism a boy is always
carried to church on the nurse’s right arm—a girl on the left.” (Trede,
<cite><span lang="de">Das Heidentum in der römischen Kirche</span></cite>, iii. p. 299.)</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span><span class='sc'>Note 4</span>, p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>.—Small birds of all kinds—thrushes, larks, sparrows,
bullfinches, even nightingales—are looked upon as fair game in Italy,
and caught wholesale in clap-nets for the table.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Note 5</span>, p. <a href='#Page_209'>209</a>.—The confraternities frequently mentioned in stories
depicting Italian life may need a word of explanation. When the
scene of the story is in Tuscany, the confraternity meant is that of the
<i><span lang="it">Misericordia</span></i> (the “Chaplain of the Misericordia” figures in Pratesi’s
sketch of “Doctor Phœbus”), whose business it is to bury the
indigent dead, and attend what in England would be pauper funerals.
The procession of ghastly black figures, their heads and faces covered
by hoods with eye-holes cut in them, is familiar to every one who has
spent any time in an Italian town. The following account of their
origin is taken from Mrs. Oliphant’s <cite>Makers of Florence</cite>:—“This still
active and numerous society was established in the thirteenth century
by an honest porter, one Pietro Borsi, who had the fine inspiration of
at once reforming the vices and employing the idle moments of his
brother porters, hanging on waiting for work in the Piazza of San
Giovanni, by a most characteristic and appropriate charity. He
persuaded them to fine each other for swearing, a mutual tax, half
humorous, half pious, which pleased the rough fellows; then induced
them to buy litters with the money thus collected, and to give, each in
his turn, a cast of his trade to the service of the sick and wounded,
carrying the victims of accident or disease to the hospitals, and the
dead to their burial. In so warlike a city as Florence, amid all the
disturbances of the thirteenth century, no doubt they had occupation
enough, and this spontaneous good work, devised by the people for the
people, marks one of the finest and most characteristic features of the
charity of the Middle Ages. The institution grew, as might be
expected, developing into greater formality and more extended operations,
but always retaining the same object. There are no longer street
frays in Florence, to make the charitable succour of the Misericordia a
thing of hourly necessity, and the litters are no longer carried by the
rough, homely hands of labouring men snatching a moment for charity
out of their hard day’s labours. It is said that all classes, up to the
very highest, form part of the society nowadays; called by their bell
when their services are wanted, in all the districts of the city, prince
and artisan taking their turns alike, and it may be together, but with
this modification—and with the one addition to its aims, that the
Brothers often nurse as well as carry the sick—the porters’ original
undertaking is carried out with a firm faithfulness at once to tradition
and Christian charity. The dress is in reality no sign of mysterious
shame and expiation, but merely a precaution against any trafficking on
the part of the brethren in the gratitude of their patients, from whom
they are allowed to receive nothing more than a draught of water, the
first and cheapest of necessities.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a> The following, from Story’s <cite><span lang="it">Roba
di Roma</span></cite>, may also be interesting:—“The admirable institution of the
<i><span lang="it">Misericordia</span></i>, which is to be found throughout Tuscany, does not exist
in Rome; but several of the confraternities attend to the duties of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>burying their own dead, and one of them, called the <i><span lang="it">Arciconfraternita
della Morte e dell’ Orazione</span></i>, assumes the duty of burying the bodies of
all poor persons found dead in the Campagna, or in the city. This
confraternity was founded in 1551 by a Siennese priest, Crescenzio
Selva, and confirmed by Pius IV. in 1560.... It is composed of
most respectable persons, who wear a <i><span lang="it">sacco</span></i> of black, coarse linen.
Upon information being received that a dead body has been found on
the Campagna, notice of the fact is at once given to a certain number
of the brethren, who, without delay, meet at the oratory, where they
assume the black sack, and set out without delay in search of the
corpse. Day or night, cold or wet, calm or storm, make no difference;
the moment the news is received they set off on their pious expedition.
Nor is this duty always a light one, for sometimes they are obliged to
journey in search of the body more than twenty miles; and, under
the pontificate of Clement VIII., when there was a great inundation
of the Tiber, they reclaimed bodies which had been borne down by the
current as far as Ostia and Fiumicino. They carry with them the bier,
upon which they place the body when it is found, and bring it back
on their shoulders to the city. Besides this duty on the Campagna, they
also, in common with certain other confraternities, bury the bodies of
the dead found in the city, where families are without means. The
<i><span lang="it">Mandataro</span></i> informs the brethren where their services are needed, and,
towards evening, dressed in thin black sacks, their heads and faces
covered, and with only two holes cut in the <i><span lang="it">cappuccio</span></i> to look through,
they may be seen passing through the street, bearing the body on their
bier to the church, preceded by a long, narrow standard of black, on
which are worked a cross, skull, and bones, bearing torches and
chanting the <cite><span lang="it">Miserere</span></cite> and other psalms.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Note 6</span>, p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>.—The Roman Catholic clergy are forbidden to
smoke, but allowed to take snuff. The point of this sentence is fully
brought out, a page or two later on, by the friar’s indignant denunciations
of eating meat in Lent.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Note 7</span>, p. <a href='#Page_230'>230</a>.—“Come, I will show you Lucca,” is said in joke to
children, the person addressing them seizing and lifting them by the
neck. The saying is probably connected with the idiom, “I shall see
you again at Lucca”—<em>i.e.</em>, ironically, “I shall never see you again;”
so that “seeing Lucca” = “seeing nothing.” Tommaseo and Bellini
(<em>Dizionario</em>) suggest that the expression may refer to the fact that the
Lucchese were great travellers.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF WRITERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Edmondo de Amicis</span>, born in 1846 at Oneglia (on the Genoa coast),
was educated at Cuneo, Turin, and the Military College of
Modena, which he left, with the grade of sub-lieutenant, in 1865.
In 1866 he was present at the battle of Custozza, and in 1867
edited a military periodical at Florence. After the Italian occupation
of Rome in 1870 he left the army, and devoted himself
entirely to literature. He is in a certain sense a follower of
Manzoni, who encouraged and directed his early efforts. His
“Sketches of Military Life” (one of which is translated in the
present collection) first saw the light in the pages of the <cite><span lang="it">Italia
Militare</span></cite>, and were followed by a collection of <cite><span lang="it">Novelle</span></cite> (or short
stories), which, however, are inferior to the first-named work.
The construction is defective, and the characterisation, though
vivacious, not very deep or subtle. Another fault which De
Amicis frequently falls into is a certain straining after pathos,
which defeats its own object—a fault which Dickens, in his desire
to draw tears, was not always exempt from. This is perhaps most
apparent in his later works, of which <cite><span lang="it">Cuore</span></cite> and another depicting
the life (a most wretched one, if De Amicis is to be believed)
of an Italian elementary schoolmaster, are examples. He has
travelled extensively, and given to the world several lively and
humorous volumes recording his experiences in Holland, Spain,
Morocco, and elsewhere—besides being well known as a lecturer.
We understand he is now resident at Turin, and has, quite
recently, proclaimed himself a convert to Socialistic ideas.
(<em>Page <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Lodovico Ariosto</span> was born at Reggio (near Modena, not to be confused
with Reggio in Calabria) in 1474. He has written his own
autobiography in the <cite>Satires</cite>. He studied law at Padua, but
never had any taste for that profession, and never practised it. In
1503 he entered the service of the Cardinal Ippolito d’Este, who
employed him on various diplomatic missions, but left him leisure
to continue his studies. In 1516 he published his great poem, the
<cite><span lang="it">Orlando Furioso</span></cite>, which he had spent ten years in writing. After
the death of his patron in 1520, Ariosto transferred his services to
the cardinal’s brother, Alfonso, Duke of Ferrara, who, in 1522,
appointed him governor of the mountainous district of Garfagnana,
near Lucca—a post he has humorously described in his <cite>Satires</cite>.
In 1524 he returned to Ferrara, and spent the rest of his life in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>lettered leisure at Alfonso’s court. He now wrote his five blank
verse comedies (<cite><span lang="it">La Cassaria</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">I Suppositi</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">La Lena</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Il Negromante</span></cite>,
and <cite><span lang="it">La Scolastica</span></cite>), which were acted before the court in a theatre
built for the purpose by order of the Duke. He died in 1533 of a
lingering illness. He was never married. The <cite><span lang="it">Orlando Furioso</span></cite>,
says one writer, “has been translated into most European languages,
but seldom successfully. Of the English translations, that
by Harrington is spirited, and much superior to Hook’s, but Rose’s
is considered the best, and is generally faithful.” A specimen
from the <cite>Satires</cite> has been given in T. H. Croker’s version. Of the
<cite><span lang="it">Orlando Furioso</span></cite>, it has been thought best, after consideration, to
give a free prose translation (selected and slightly adapted from
<cite>Stories from Ariosto</cite>, by H. C. Hollway-Calthrop<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a>) of the passage
describing Astolfo’s visit to the moon, which is one of the best for
exhibiting the humorous side of Ariosto’s genius. The poem is a
gigantic one, with legions of characters, and a perfect maze of
episodes more or less closely connected with the main thread of
the story: the war between Charlemagne and the Saracens, ending
with the defeat of the latter and the death of their king, Agramante.
If those who are in at the death of Spenser’s Blatant Beast are very
few and very weary, we should imagine that those who have
followed Agramante to his bitter end must be fewer and wearier
still. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Francesco Berni</span>, a Tuscan, was born in 1490, and died in 1536 as
canon of the cathedral at Florence. He was a priest, and spent
the greater part of his life at the court of Rome, in the service of
various cardinals and prelates. A writer in the <cite>National Encyclopædia</cite>
says, “Berni is one of the principal writers of Italian jocose
poetry, which has ever since retained the name of <cite><span lang="it">Poesia Bernesca</span></cite>.
This style had been introduced before him” (see Note on <cite><span lang="it">Pucci</span></cite>),
“but Berni carried it to a degree of perfection which has rarely
been equalled since.... His satire is generally of the milder sort,
but at times it rises to a bitter strain of invective. His humour
may be said to be untranslatable, for it depends on the genius of
the Italian language, the constitution of the Italian mind, and the
habits and associations of the Italian people. His language is
choice Tuscan. The worst feature in Berni’s humorous poems is
his frequent licentious allusions and equivocations, which, though
clothed in decent language, are well understood by Italian readers.”
It is, perhaps, curious that another great offender in this respect—Casti—was
also an ecclesiastic. But we cannot help remembering
in this connection a remark made by a writer in an English magazine,
who had been invited to a wedding in an Italian country
town—viz., that of the congratulatory verses sent in by friends
(some of which were very far from being in accordance with our
notions of propriety) the most objectionable were written by
priests. Three volumes of Berni’s <cite><span lang="it">Poesie Burlesche</span></cite> were collected
and published after his death. He also wrote what he called a <i><span lang="it">rifacimento</span></i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>of Bojardo’s <cite><span lang="it">Orlando Innamorata</span></cite>, altering the diction of
the poem into what he considered purer Italian, and adding some
stanzas of his own. More satisfactory productions, perhaps, are
<cite><span lang="it">La Catrina</span></cite> and <cite><span lang="it">Il Migliazzo</span></cite>, dramatic scenes written in the rustic
dialect of Tuscany. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Giovanni Boccaccio</span> was born at Paris in 1313. His father, a native
of Certaldo, near Florence, brought him to the latter city when quite
a child, intending to educate him for commerce, in which he was
himself engaged. He escaped from this life at the age of twenty
by promising to study canonical law, which, however, proved not
much more to his taste than business, and his principal pursuits at
the University of Naples were Greek (then beginning to be studied
in Italy), Latin, and mathematics. At Naples, too, he made the
acquaintance of Petrarch, and fell in love with the Princess Maria,
a natural daughter of King Robert, for whom he wrote his poem
of the <cite><span lang="it">Teseide</span></cite>, containing the tale of “Palaemon and Arcite,”
afterwards made use of by Chaucer. In 1350 Boccaccio returned to
Florence, and appears to have gradually changed his way of life, and
become known as a quiet and orderly citizen. In 1361 he retired
from the world altogether, and became a priest. He visited
Petrarch at Milan, and again (in 1363) at Venice, and kept up his
friendship with him to the end of his life. In 1373 he was
appointed by the Republic of Florence to give public readings, with
comments, of Dante’s <cite><span lang="it">Divina Commedia</span></cite>; but these lectures were
often interrupted by ill-health, and Boccaccio died in December
1375. His earliest work was in verse, but finding that he could
not hope to attain first-rate excellence in poetry he turned his
attention chiefly to prose. The <cite><span lang="it">Decameron</span></cite> was one of the earliest
prose works written in Italian, and is esteemed a classic for its
style. The plan, perhaps, suggested that of Chaucer’s <cite><span lang="it">Canterbury
Tales</span></cite>; the hundred tales of which it consists being supposed to be
told by ten persons on ten different days—hence the name (from
the Greek words for <em>ten days</em>). The introduction relates how the
narrators—seven ladies and three knights—having fled to the
country to escape from the plague which desolated Florence in
1348, enlivened the solitude of their villa by telling stories. Some
of these tales are lively and humorous, some pathetic and tragic.
Many of them, as is well known, are better left in oblivion; some,
indeed, being good comedy spoilt by that which renders it unquotable;
while others, if ever they were found amusing, must
have been so by reason of their coarseness, for they have no other
claim. Others, again, reach a very high level, as that of “Nathan
and Mithridanes”; or that other of the three rings, on which Lessing
founded his drama of <cite><span lang="it">Nathan der Weise</span></cite>. The story of “Calandrino
and the Heliotrope” is, we believe, one of the best farcical
ones. Buffalmacco and his practical jokes seem to have been the
common property of the comic writers of the period, and probably
all “<i><span lang="it">burle</span></i>” or “japes” which were thought more than commonly
amusing were indiscriminately fathered upon him. His real life is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>given by Vasari, from whom we have also culled one or two of the
more celebrated <i><span lang="it">burle</span></i>, which, however, belonging to popular
tradition, had previously been related by Sacchetti. In the same
way, at a later period, every witty saying and ridiculous adventure
current in Florence was attributed to the dramatist G. B. Fagiuoli
(1660–1742). Anecdotes of the latter may be picked up among the
Florentine populace even now; but the practical joke related of
him (we hope falsely) in Pitré’s collection of folk-tales will not bear
repetition. Other Joe Millers of Italy are the Florentine Piovano
Arlotto, Gonnella, and Barlacchia, various collections of whose
jests have from time to time been published. The translation
given (as also in the case of the selections from Parabosco and
Sabadino degli Arienti) is Thomas Roscoe’s. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_2'>2</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Luigi Capuana</span>, Sicilian novelist and critic, born at Mineo, in the
province of Catania, May 27, 1839. His first published works
were poems, among others an imitation of Tommy Moore’s <cite>Loves of
the Angels</cite>. In 1864 he went to Florence, where he was for two
years dramatic critic to <cite><span lang="it">La Nazione</span></cite>. The best of the articles
written for that paper he afterwards published in volume form,
under the title, <cite><span lang="it">Teatro italiano Contemporaneo</span></cite>. In 1868 he
returned to his native place, and remained there till 1876. During
this time he was chosen Syndic of the district, and in 1875 published
an official report on <cite><span lang="it">The Commune of Mineo</span></cite>, which is really
worthy of the name of a contribution to literature. In 1877
he removed to Milan, and resumed his literary labours, writing
critical articles in the <cite><span lang="it">Corriere delle Sera</span></cite>, and also a number
of sketches, afterwards collected in volume form, under the
title, <cite><span lang="it">Profili di donne</span></cite>. Since then he has issued various works
of fiction, mostly collections of short stories—or rather character-sketches—for
some of them have scarcely any story to speak
of. The specimens in the present volume are taken from a
collection entitled <cite><span lang="it">Fumando</span></cite>. Capuana is a great admirer of
Émile Zola, and aims at his style and methods; but his Italian
(or perhaps Greek, since he is a Sicilian!) sense of beauty and
proportion preserve him from the grossest faults of the extreme
naturalist school. He needs, however, to guard against the dangers
of Impressionism; at least we suppose that is the name for the
tendency to give detached “bits” instead of pictures—a tendency
which appears to excess in his short stories. He has written two
complete novels, <cite><span lang="it">Giacinta</span></cite>, and <cite><span lang="it">Storia Fosca</span></cite>; and a charming
collection of popular fairy tales, retold for children under the
title of <cite><span lang="it">C’era una volta</span></cite> (“Once upon a time”). (<em>Page <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Enrico Castelnuovo</span>, born at Florence, 1839, has passed the
greater part of his life at Venice, where he appears to be still
resident. From 1853 to 1870 he was engaged in business, but in
the latter year became editor of a political paper, <cite><span lang="it">La Stampa</span></cite>.
Since then he has published several novels and collections of short
stories, some of which have appeared in the <cite><span lang="it">Perseveranza</span></cite>. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>of the best known of them are: <cite><span lang="it">La Casa Bianca</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Vittorina</span></cite>,
<cite><span lang="it">Lauretta</span></cite> (1876), <cite><span lang="it">Il Professõr Romualdo</span></cite> (1878), <cite><span lang="it">Nuovi Racconti</span></cite>,
<cite><span lang="it">Alla Finestra</span></cite>, and <cite><span lang="it">Sorrisi e Lacrime</span></cite>, from which the sketch in the
present volume is taken. Most of his stories deal with Venetian
life. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_191'>191</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Giovanni Battista Casti</span>, 1721–1803, was an ecclesiastic, and the
author of many satirical works, of which the best known is <cite><span lang="it">Gli
Animali Parlanti</span></cite> (The Speaking Animals), which has, I believe,
been translated as <cite>The Court and Parliament of Beasts</cite>. He also
wrote a sequence of a hundred sonnets, entitled <cite><span lang="it">I Tre Giuli</span></cite>, which
is surely the most striking instance extant of an idea ridden to
death. The sonnets (of which one here and there is fairly amusing)
are all on the subject of a debt of about eighteenpence which the
author owed a friend. They hardly merit the extremely laudatory
language used about them by the translator, M. Montague (1841).
A much greater contribution to the gaiety of nations is the “opera
buffa” of <cite><span lang="it">Il Re Teodoro</span></cite>, for which Paisiello wrote the music, and from
which we have given an extract. Casti wrote other comic operas,
one of the best of which is <cite><span lang="it">Catiline’s Conspiracy</span></cite>, in which the famous
exordium of Cicero’s oration, <cite><span lang="it">Quousque tandem</span></cite>, is rendered (and
pretty closely too) into burlesque verse. Cicero is shown in his
study, preparing his oration with infinite pains. When at length
it is delivered, the interruptions of Catiline and others are faithfully
reported.</p>

<p class='c024'>This is pretty good fooling, and the compound conjunction (a
sort of double-barrelled <cite><span lang="it">Forasmuch as</span></cite>, often used in legal
phraseology), to which the orator clings desperately, when so rudely
thrown out in his speech, comes in with the happiest effect. But
the effect of the rapid rush of the double-rhymed octo-syllables
would be quite lost in a translation. They have somewhat the
character of the smart and fluent verse in Mr. W. S. Gilbert’s
operas. Besides verse, Casti wrote prose <i><span lang="it">Novelle</span></i>, to which Cantù
(<cite><span lang="it">Letteratura Italiana</span></cite>, vol. ii.) gives the worst character. Of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span><cite><span lang="it">Animali Parlanti</span></cite>, the same author says that it “satirised Governments
with the liberalism of the <i><span lang="fr">café</span></i>” (as we might say “of taproom
politicians”) “and in the style of an <i><span lang="it">improvisatore</span></i>.” It is
a somewhat long-winded work in six-line stanzas. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Baldassare Castiglione</span>, born in the Mantuan territory in 1478,
was attached, first to the court of Lodovico the Moor, at Milan;
afterwards, in succession to those of Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis
of Mantua, and Guidobaldo, Duke of Urbino. He was a polished
gentleman and brilliant scholar, “a perfect knight, second to none
either in intellect or culture.” Charles V. pronounced him “one
of the best knights in the world.” The court of Urbino, at that
time “a school of courtesy and valour, as well as of learning,” was
a fitting home for such a man. He took part in more than one
campaign, and was sent as ambassador to England, to Milan, and
to Rome. He died at Toledo in 1529, while on a diplomatic
mission to the Emperor Charles V., it is said, of grief at the sack
of Rome by the Spaniards under the Constable de Bourbon.
Raphael painted his portrait in life; Guido Romano designed his
tomb after his death, and Pietro Bembo wrote his epitaph. He
wrote many elegant and scholarly poems, both in Latin and
Italian; but his fame as an author rests entirely on the book
entitled <cite><span lang="it">Il Cortigiano</span></cite> (The Courtier). It consists of a series of
dialogues in which the qualities necessary to the character of a
perfect courtier are discussed. It seems to have been written at
Mantua, during the short period of his happy wedded life (his
wife, Ippolita Torelli, married in 1516, died three years
later). The style is courtly and polished, though with a certain
simplicity in its stateliness. The interlocutors sometimes relieve
their grave philosophy by humorous anecdotes, of which a few
specimens are given in the text. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Francesco Cerlone</span> lived during the latter half of the eighteenth
century, and wrote an immense number of plays of the <cite><span lang="it">Commedia
dell’ Arte</span></cite> type. His works were published, in a collected form,
at Bologna in 1787, and again (in twenty-two volumes) at Naples,
in 1825–29. Little seems to be known about him. Symonds
calls him “a plebeian poet of Naples.” The distinguished Italian
critic, Michele Scherillo, “discovered” him not many years ago.

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>C. Collodi</span> is the pseudonym of a brilliant Tuscan writer, Carlo
Lorenzini, a frequent contributor to <cite><span lang="it">Fanfulla</span></cite>. He was for some
time theatrical censor to the Prefecture of Florence. He has also
written children’s books, and one or more volumes of short stories.

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Napoleone Corazzini</span>, born in Tuscany about 1840, had a natural
bent towards humorous writing, but was prevented by circumstances
from following it out, though a farce (or rather parody) of his,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>called <cite><span lang="it">The Duel</span></cite>, is sometimes acted. He spent some time in
Herzegovina as a newspaper correspondent, but was forced, on his
return, to forsake literature for commerce. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Paolo Ferrari</span>, writer of comedies, was born at Modena in 1822.
His father was an official in the service of the Duke, and young
Ferrari’s liberal sentiments were a great disadvantage to him at
the outset of his career. It is even said (with what truth I do not
know) that they induced the Duke to interfere with the granting
of his University degree, which was delayed for a long time. But
Ferrari’s legal studies had been pursued with so little ardour as to
suggest another reason for the action of the University authorities.
His first comedy was written in 1847, and was called <cite><span lang="it">Bartolommeo
the Shoemaker</span></cite>, a title afterwards changed to <cite><span lang="it">Uncle Venanzio’s
Codicil</span></cite>. After contending with many difficulties, he wrote his
<cite><span lang="it">Goldoni</span></cite> in 1852, but had to wait two years before it was produced,
when it was a signal success. Since then he has given to the
world a long series of works, chiefly comedies, and the Italians
consider him their first comic dramatist. Some of his greatest
successes are his dramas, drawn from Italian history, in which
the characters—unlike those in the ordinary historical drama—are
rather literary than political. Such are <cite><span lang="it">Dante a Verona</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Parini e
la Satira</span></cite>, and the above-mentioned <cite><span lang="it">Goldoni e le sue Sedici Commedie</span></cite>.
He writes either in prose or in a kind of rhymed alexandrines
called <cite><span lang="it">Versi Martelliani</span></cite>. Of his other dramas the greatest
are <cite><span lang="it">Il Duello</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Il Suicidio</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Gli amici rivali</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Cause ed effetti</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Il
Ridicolo</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Gli Uomini Serii</span></cite>. Nearly all of his plays which are
still on the stage have obtained the Government prize offered in
Italy for dramatic excellence. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Piero Francesco Leopoldo Coccoluto Ferrigni</span>, better known
under the name of “Yorick,” is a Tuscan writer; born at Leghorn
in 1836, though of Neapolitan descent. He began his literary
career in 1854 by contributing “correspondence” to some of the
Florentine papers. In 1856 he first adopted the pseudonym which
has become so famous—from Hamlet, not from Sterne. Indeed,
when he became acquainted with the latter’s works, he felt as if
he had been guilty of presumption, and thenceforth signed his
articles, <cite><span lang="it">Yorick, son of Yorick</span></cite>. He took a brilliant law degree at
Siena in 1857, and has made his mark as an advocate, though
his reputation is principally journalistic and literary. Florentine
newsboys may be heard using his name to enhance the attractions
of their wares. “C’è l’articolo di Yorick,” they will say, or more
briefly, “C’è Yorick!” (There’s Yorick in it). Like many living
Italian writers, he bore his part in the War of Liberation. He
volunteered in 1859, when, for some time, he acted as Garibaldi’s
private secretary, and in 1860 he was wounded at Milazzo. He is a
writer of great ease and fluency—and not in his own language only—sending
contributions in French to the <cite><span lang="it">Indépendance Italienne</span></cite>,
and in German to the <cite><span lang="it">Neue Freie Presse</span></cite>. He appears to be one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>of the few Italians who have found literature profitable. Many of
his newspaper articles have been collected in volume form. The
specimens here quoted are taken from “Cronache dei Bagni di
Mare” (part of which was reproduced in English by the <cite><span lang="it">Morning
Post</span></cite>), and “Su e giù per Firenze.” (<em>Page <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Antonio Ghislanzoni</span>, son of a doctor at Lecco, on the Lake of
Como, was born in 1824. His father first wished him to become
a priest, and then sent him to study medicine at Pavia; but the
youth, finding that he possessed a splendid baritone, studied singing
instead, and in 1846 obtained an engagement at the Lodi
Theatre. In 1848 he took to journalism, and ran two papers at
Milan; the extreme political opinions advocated in which soon
landed him in prison. After the return of the Austrians he was
exiled, and, after another imprisonment in Corsica, continued his
musical career there and in Paris, till he lost his voice (in 1854) in
consequence of an attack of bronchitis, and returned to literature
and Italy. He edited various papers, wrote a variety of articles,
mostly of a comic character, and composed the <i><span lang="it">libretti</span></i> to several
operas, of which the best known is Verdi’s <cite><span lang="it">Aida</span></cite>. For some time
past he has resided in a little house of his own at Lecco. He
edited, and in great part wrote, the <cite><span lang="it">Rivista Minima</span></cite>, which
afterwards passed into the hands of his friend, Salvatore Farina.
(<em>Page <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Giuseppe Giusti</span>, born at Monsummano, in Val di Nievole (Tuscany),
in 1809. He received his early education, between the ages of seven
and twelve, from a priest; its results being, to use his own words,
“sundry canings, not a shadow of Latin, a few glimmerings of
history, discouragement, irritation, weariness, and an inward conviction
that I was good for nothing.” He then attended a school
in Florence, where he came under the care of more intelligent and
sympathetic masters, and began to awaken to the love of knowledge.
He afterwards went to the University of Pisa, but (like our
own Wordsworth and others) made no special progress in the
studies proper to the place. In later life he lamented the idleness
and desultory habits of these years; but it is probable that, in following
the bent of his intellect towards popular and general literature,
and picking up songs and stories in the racy idiom of the Tuscan
hills, he was laying the best possible foundation for his future career
as a poet. His health was never good, and he died, comparatively
young, in 1850, thus disappointing the brilliant expectations his
friends had formed. What he did accomplish, however, is sufficient
to secure him a place in the first rank of modern Italian literature.
Besides the <cite><span lang="it">Poems</span></cite> (of which several collected editions have
been published) his principal works are a collection of Tuscan proverbs
(with introduction and notes) and a <cite><span lang="it">Discourse on the Life
and Works of Giuseppe Parini</span></cite>, the satirist. Since his death there
have been published a volume of his letters, and one of unpublished
pieces in prose and verse, the principal of which is a commentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>on Dante’s <cite><span lang="it">Divina Commedia</span></cite>. His poems are peculiarly difficult
to translate, on account of their exceedingly idiomatic character, as
well as, in many cases, of their personal and political bearing. They
have a directness, vigour, and pungency rare in the literature of Italy
during the first half of this century. His political satire rises
sometimes into noble indignation, as in the fine poem beginning,
<i><span lang="it">A noi, larve d’Italia</span></i>, which has been translated into English, if we
mistake not, at least twice. His non-political satire is always
kindly and good-humoured, and the same spirit, along with an
irrepressible cheerfulness and boyish love of fun, comes out in his
letters—especially those to his intimate friend, Manzoni. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Count Gasparo Gozzi</span>, elder brother of Carlo Gozzi, the dramatist,
was a Venetian, and lived from 1713 to 1786. The Gozzi
family might be described as that of “a penniless laird wi’ a lang
pedigree,” and the <cite><span lang="it">Memoirs of Count Carlo</span></cite> contain a vivid account
of the straits and shifts to which they were put. Gasparo hoped to
retrieve the family circumstances by his marriage with a learned
lady given to poetry, Luisa Bergalli or Bargagli (who rejoiced in
the academic title of Irminda Partenide); but her extravagance
and shiftlessness only made matters worse, and he was forced
to do anonymous hack-work—translations from the French,
and the like—for a living; or, as he calls it, to wear himself
out “in unknown writings with the daily sweat of one’s
brow, and drag works—either insignificant or vile—out of the
Gallic idiom into the Italian language.” Notwithstanding this,
he contrived to do a tolerable amount of work which has lasted.
His style is simple, clear, and pure, though without much vigour;
and, as Cantù says, he has the gift of “coupling fancy with
observation, and wit with feeling.” He issued for some time
a paper called <cite><span lang="it">L’Osservatore</span></cite> on the plan of Addison’s <cite><span lang="it">Spectator</span></cite>.
He wrote a great many “Bernesque” poems—sonnets <i><span lang="it">a coda</span></i>, and
satirical pieces in blank verse. His letters also are excellent.

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Giacomo Leopardi</span>, born at Recanati, in the Duchy of Urbino, in
1798, suffered all his life from ill-health and real or fancied uncongenial
surroundings. He was heavily handicapped in the race
of life, being hunchbacked, as well as constitutionally diseased;
and thus the pessimistic doctrines which he imbibed from Pietro
Giordani fell on a fertile soil. His father was rich and possessed
a splendid library, and though he refused to allow Giacomo to go
away to school, the boy threw himself into his studies at home
with so much ardour that at fifteen he was a brilliant classical
scholar, and wrote an ode in Greek which competent critics
believed to be ancient. Yet he long remained unknown, thwarted
by his father’s harshness in all his efforts to obtain a wider culture
and more literary opportunities. At last he was able to escape
from his hated home to Rome, where he enjoyed the society of
literary men; but could not succeed, as he had hoped, in obtaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>some professorship. He then, embittered and disgusted with the
world, retired to Milan, where he lived in the house of a publisher
and prepared his poems for the press. Here too he was unable
to escape from the misery which pursued him, and his health
became worse and worse. At last, in the autumn of 1831, he
took his last journey—to Naples, where Antonio Ranieri, his
untiring friend, received him into his house. There, worn out
by dropsy and consumption, he died on July 14th, 1837. Of
his philosophical works, and his splendid, gloomy verse, it is not
the place to speak. I have included him in this collection on
account of some of his dialogues, which are masterpieces of a
subtle irony which has the air of simplicity and bites to the bone.
It is keener and more delicate than Swift’s, but otherwise very
difficult to describe. One cannot easily imagine that Leopardi
ever laughed; but no one could read the “First Hour and the
Sun,” or the “Wager of Prometheus,” and think him wanting in
humour. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Niccolo Machiavelli</span>, a Florentine, lived from 1469 to 1527. His
place in this volume is due to his comedy of <cite><span lang="it">La Mandragola</span></cite>,
of which a scene is given; but this, of course, is not the work by
which he is best known in history. Macaulay’s well-known essay
gives a very good summary of his political and literary labours.
He first took part in public affairs in 1494; in 1498 he was
elected Secretary to the Florentine Republic, an office which he
resigned in 1512, after the return of the Medici. Some time afterwards,
being suspected of a conspiracy against the latter, he was
imprisoned and put to the torture, nearly dying under it. He was
included in the amnesty proclaimed by Giovanni di Medici, when
raised to the Papacy under the title of Leo X. Though restored
to liberty, he could take no part in politics, and finding himself
unable to serve Florence, and condemned to a hateful inaction,
he retired to his country-house, where he wrote the greater part
of his works. The last of these was the <cite><span lang="it">History of Florence</span></cite>,
written at the request of Pope Clement VII., and completed in
1525. In 1519 Leo X. consulted him about reforming the government
of Florence, but his advice was not followed. In 1526, when
the Constable Bourbon began to threaten Tuscany and Rome,
Clement VII. again consulted Machiavelli, and entrusted him
with the fortification of Florence, and with the precautions to be
taken for the safety of Rome; but these precautions came too late.
The Pope was taken prisoner, and the Medici once more driven
from Florence; and Machiavelli being now looked upon as a
partisan of that family, fell into neglect, and may be said to have
died of grief and disappointment. His chief works besides the
<cite><span lang="it">History</span></cite>, are the <cite><span lang="it">Prince</span></cite>, the <cite><span lang="it">Art of War</span></cite>, and the <cite><span lang="it">Discourses on the
First Decade of Livy</span></cite>. Besides this, he wrote two or three
comedies and a witty <i><span lang="it">novella</span></i> (somewhat extravagant, though, in
its satire), entitled <cite><span lang="it">Belphegor</span></cite>. It relates how one of the devils,
taking the form of a man, came to earth in order to try the experiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>of matrimony; but was so very wretched in his married life,
that, after a short trial, he preferred returning to the region whence
he came. It is said that Machiavelli’s experiences in his own
home gave point to his descriptions of Madonna Onesta’s folly and
extravagance. The <cite><span lang="it">Mandragola</span></cite>, in spite of Macaulay’s high
praise, offers scarcely anything adapted for quotation. The play is
admirably constructed, but the story is one which would render it
“impossible” for a modern audience. We have been forced to

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Alessandro Manzoni</span>, born at Milan 1784, died 1873. One of the
leaders of the Romantic Movement in Italy, and the founder (in
that country) of the historical novel in the style of Scott.
The <cite><span lang="it">Promessi Sposi</span></cite>, published in 1827 (from which we have
quoted a scene or two), has probably been translated into every
European language. Less widely known are his tragedies, <cite><span lang="it">Adelchi</span></cite>
and <cite><span lang="it">Il Conte di Carmagnola</span></cite>, and his <cite><span lang="it">Odes</span></cite> (1815), the most
famous of which is that on the death of Napoleon—<cite><span lang="it">Il Cinque
Maggio</span></cite>. He was followed in the department of historical fiction
by his son-in-law, D’Azeglio, and by Grossi, Guerrazzi, Rosini,
Ademollo, and others. Though at first sight <cite><span lang="it">I Promessi Sposi</span></cite>
might seem anything but a humorous work, there are scenes
equal in this respect to some of the best in Scott’s novels. That
of the attempted irregular marriage (which we have chosen for
quotation) is especially good, and the character of Don Abbondio
is comically conceived throughout. Perhaps the book has been
somewhat neglected of late years—it has certainly, like many
other masterpieces, suffered undeservedly through being used as
a school-book. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_82'>82</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Filippo Pananti</span> was born at Ronta, in the district of Mugello
(Tuscany), about 1776, and studied law at Pisa, but afterwards
gave himself up entirely to literature. He went abroad in 1799,
and after visiting France, Spain, and Holland, obtained a
position as libretto-writer to the Italian Opera in London. When
returning to Italy by sea he was taken prisoner by Algerine
pirates, but liberated through the intervention of the English
consul. “He then came to Florence, and published his works—viz.,
<cite><span lang="it">Il Poeta di Teatro</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Prose e Versi</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Viaggio in Algeria</span></cite>, in
which it may be said that he is often negligent rather than simple,
and that he makes use unnecessarily of foreign expressions, or of
such as are not yet accepted as current in the conversation of the
best educated persons; yet he pleases, nevertheless, and deserves
to do so, by his vivid and racy way of expressing himself, and his
ease and fluency. He died in 1837.”—(<span class='sc'>Ambrosoli.</span>) <cite><span lang="it">Il Poeta di

endured by a poet of small means. It is thoroughly good-humoured

it. We have extracted one or two passages. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_70'>70</a>.</em>)</p>

at St. Mark’s, Venice. But he is best known by <cite><span lang="it">I Diporti</span></cite>,
a collection of stories after the model of Boccaccio’s <cite><span lang="it">Decameron</span></cite>,

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Mario Pratesi</span>, a Tuscan writer, was born at Santafiora, in the
district of Monte Amiata, in 1842. At eighteen he became a
clerk in a Government office, and remained at this distasteful
employment till 1864, when he returned to his studies, and in
1872 obtained an appointment as lecturer on Italian literature at
the Pavia Technical Institute, whence he passed to a similar post
at Viterbo, and thence to Terni. Most of his stories, since collected
in volume form, first appeared in the <cite><span lang="it">Nuova Antologia</span></cite>, and he has
contributed to the <cite><span lang="it">Diritto</span></cite>, the <cite><span lang="it">Rassegna Settimanale</span></cite>, and the
<cite><span lang="it">Nazione</span></cite> (Florence). He has also written poems. He is at his best
when describing the scenery of his native mountains. Monte
Amiata, it may be remembered, was the scene of the strange
religious revival led by the insane peasant-preacher, David
Lazzaretti, who was shot down by the gendarmes in August 1878.
It is a wild, lonely region, lying between the river Ombrone and
the Roman border—a land of craggy peaks and dark glens,
inhabited by simple, serious-minded people with a touch of gloomy
mysticism in their character, perhaps due to Etruscan ancestry.
The immediate neighbourhood of the district where the tragedy
took place is admirably described in “Sovana.” Pratesi is
intensely sympathetic in his manner of depicting life. He does
not aim at an “objectivity” which seems to glory in appearing
cold and heartless; but he does not dwell unnecessarily on his
pathetic scenes. He relates them with grim brevity, and leaves
them to produce their own effect. He has an eye for the ludicrous,
but it does not predominate in his view of life; he never laughs,
but he often smiles quietly, and sometimes grimly. <cite><span lang="it">Dottor Febo</span></cite>
is a good example of his subtle irony, and has been given entire, as
no detached passage would show to advantage. He is fully alive
to the great evils of priestcraft and ignorance from which Italy has
suffered in the past, but he is no radical of the type which is all
negation and no affirmation. His attitude towards the clergy is
impartial enough—he has drawn them of all sorts, good and bad.
In the story before us there are three, and those who have
resided any length of time in Italy must have met them all: the
spiteful, hypocritical preaching friar, the jovial, easy-going <cite><span lang="it">Arciprete</span></cite>
(who would have overlooked the sin of a bit of meat on Ash
Wednesday if that meddling rascal of a Franciscan had not put
his finger in the pie), and the chaplain of the <cite><span lang="it">Confraternità</span></cite>, in his
threadbare coat,—own brother to Chaucer’s Parson. Though in
the stories here translated I have usually left all proper names in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>their original form, I have in this instance departed from the rule,
in order to bring out the quaint incongruity of the hero’s name
with his pitifully sordid life and surroundings, <cite><span lang="it">Febo</span></cite> not being perhaps
readily recognisable at first sight as <cite><span lang="it">Phœbus</span></cite>. Names as classical
as this are by no means uncommon in the Roman and Tuscan
country districts. Romolo and its feminine Romola are frequently
met with, as also Belisario, Ersilia, Flaminia, etc. Naples and
the Adriatic coast show a greater preference for Church saints;
and a peculiarity of the latter district is the frequent occurrence of
Old Testament names, which are not usual in other parts. Perhaps
this is due to Byzantine influence, and the more comprehensive
calendar of the Eastern Church; thus we find Samuele, Zacchiele,
Elia, etc. The subject of Christian names in rural Italy is an
interesting one, and would well repay study, especially in villages
where reading is almost unknown, and the names in use must be
to a large extent traditional, and probably handed down from
remote antiquity. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_206'>206</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Antonio Pucci</span>, the son of a bell-founder, was a poet, although he
kept a shop; and had not a little of that easy, sparkling vein
which, a century later, was so abundant in Berni, as to make the
latter seem like the creator of a new style of poetry. He died in
Florence, his native city, some time after 1375.” This is all I can
find with regard to Pucci in Ambrosoli’s <cite><span lang="it">Manual of Italian Literature</span></cite>.
The sonnet in which he describes the persecutions to which
a poet is subject at the hands of his friends is a not unfavourable
specimen of what the Italians call <i><span lang="it">poesia bernesca</span></i>. This kind of
sonnet is called “sonetto <em>a coda</em>,” or “with a tail,” and is much
used in humorous and satirical writing, as being a kind in which
more licence is allowable metrically, when the idea cannot be
brought within the limits of the strict sonnet form. The “tail”
may be lengthened at pleasure, but always in sets of three lines—one
short and two long—and sometimes attains to a greater length
than the original sonnet. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Francesco Redi</span>, born at Arezzo, in Tuscany, in 1626, was a jovial
physician, no less famed for his wit than for his learning and
medical skill. He studied philosophy and medicine at the University
of Pisa, and was then invited to Rome by the princes of the
House of Colonna, in whose palace he lectured on rhetoric. He
was afterwards court physician to the Grand Dukes of Tuscany.
During the last years of his life he was afflicted with epilepsy, and
retired to Pisa, as being a healthier place than Florence. Here he
died suddenly on March 1st, 1698. His published works consist
of poems, scientific treatises, and a large collection of letters which
show his wide learning, his shrewd sense, and the merry, genial
spirit which could see a funny side to his own troubles. “To
judge from the praises of his countrymen,” says Leigh Hunt, “he
partook of the wit and learning of Arbuthnot, the science of
Harvey, and the poetry and generosity of Garth.” His humour is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>rather broad than subtle—but always sweet and kindly; his
laughter is the mellow mirth of one who enjoys life himself and
wishes others to enjoy it also. He was passionately fond of
natural history, and an acute and patient observer; his papers on
vipers, on the generation of insects, and on some other subjects,
were important contributions to the science of his time. His
replies (usually at great length) to the patients who consulted him
by letter have been preserved, and are printed among his works.
In medicine, he had a wholesome faith in the healing efficacy of
nature, and anticipated the modern revolt against the excessive use
of drugs, or, as he himself puts it, “that hotch-potch of physic
which physicians, out of sheer perversity, are accustomed to prescribe
to others, but would never dream of swallowing themselves.”
His poems are not numerous, nor of the most elevated kind of
poetry; but the best known, the dithyrambus of “Bacco in
Toscana,” with its fiery swing and rush, leap, and lilt of melody,
is perhaps the most perfect thing of its kind ever done. It
awakened the enthusiasm of Leigh Hunt, from whose translation
we have extracted a passage, and whose critically appreciative
introduction is quoted below. “Bacco in Toscana” is not a poem
to be looked on with favour by total abstainers; but wine of
Montepulciano is not the most pernicious form of alcohol known to
the world (the wine on which the German cavalier in the ballad
drank himself to death was that of Montefiascone, on the other side
of the Roman border), and, moreover, the poem is no proof that
the poet really was in the habit of taking more than was good for
him. “The ‘Bacco in Toscana,’” says Leigh Hunt, “was the first
poem of its kind, and when a trifle is original even a trifle becomes
worth something.... That the nature of the subject is partly a
cause for its popularity, and that, for the same reason, it is impossible
to convey a proper Italian sense of it to an Englishman is
equally certain. But I hope it is not impossible to impart something
of its spirit and vivacity. At all events, there is a novelty in
it; the wine has a tune in the pouring out; and it is hard if some
of the verses do not haunt a good-humoured reader, like a new air
brought from the South.... It is observable that among the
friends of our author were Carlo Dati, Francini, and Antonio
Malatesti, three of Milton’s acquaintances when he was in Italy.
Redi was only twelve years of age when Milton visited his country;
but he may have seen him, and surely heard of him. It is pleasant
to trace any kind of link between eminent men. There is reason
to believe that our author was well known in England. Magalotti,
who travelled there with Cosmo, and who afterwards translated
Phillips’s <cite><span lang="it">Cyder</span></cite>, was one of his particular friends; and I cannot
help thinking, from the irregularity of numbers in Dryden’s nobler
dithyrambic, as well as from another poem of his (‘Dialogue of a
Scholar and his Mistress’), that the ‘Bacco in Toscana’ had been
seen by that great writer. Nothing is more likely; for, besides the
connection between Cosmo and Charles II., James II. made a
special request by his ambassador, Sir William Trumball, to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the poem sent him. When Spence was in Italy, many years
afterwards, the name of Redi was still in great repute, both for his
humorous poetry and his serious, though the wits had begun to
find out that his real talent lay only in the former. Crudeli, a
poet of that time, still in repute, told Spence that ‘Redi’s “Bacco
in Toscana” was as lively and excellent as his sonnets were low and
tasteless.’ And, after all, what is this ‘Bacco in Toscana’? It is
an original, an effusion of animal spirits, a piece of Bacchanalian
music. This is all; but this will not be regarded as nothing by
those who know the value of originality, and who are thankful for
any addition to our pleasures.... I wish that, by any process
not interfering with the spirit of my original, I could make up to
the English reader for the absence of that particular interest in a
poem of this kind which arises from its being national. But this
is impossible; and if he has neither a great understanding, nor a
good-nature that supplies the want of it; if he is deficient in
animal spirits, or does not value a supply of them; and, above all,
if he has no ear for a dancing measure, and no laughing welcome
for a sudden turn or two at the end of a passage—our author’s
triumph over his cups will fall on his ear like ‘a jest unprofitable.’
I confess I have both enough melancholy and merriment in me to
be at no time proof against a passage like—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>A great deal of the effect of poems of this kind consists in their
hovering between jest and earnest.... The ‘Bacco in Toscana’
partakes more or less of the mock-heroic throughout, except in the
very gravest lines of the author’s personal panegyrics. It is to the
Ode and the Dithyrambic what the ‘Rape of the Lock’ is to the
Epic, with all the inferiority which such a distinction implies....
The great fault of the poem is undoubtedly what his friend
Ménage objected to in it—namely, that Bacchus has all the talk to
himself, and Ariadne becomes a puppet by his side. Redi, partly
in answer to this objection, and partly, perhaps, out of a certain
medical conscience (for it must not be forgotten that his vinosity
is purely poetical, and that he was always insisting to his patients
on the necessity of temperance and dilutions), projected a sort of
counter-dithyrambic in praise of water, in which all the talk was to
be confined to Ariadne.... He wrote but a paragraph of this
<i><span lang="it">hydrambic</span></i>. The inspiration was not the same. As to his drinking
so little wine and yet writing so well upon it, it is a triumph for
Bacchus instead of a dishonour. It only shows how little wine
will suffice to set a genial brain in motion. A poet has wine in
his blood. The laurel and ivy were common, of old, both to
Bacchus and Apollo; at least Apollo shared the ivy always, and
Bacchus wore laurel when he was young and innocent,</p>

of one of those collections of short stories so numerous in Italian
literature, which often furnished subjects to our Elizabethan playwrights.
The dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but the
former must have been before 1450, and the latter not earlier than
1506. Besides the <cite><span lang="it">Porrettane</span></cite> (so called because the stories are

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Franco Sacchetti</span> was a Florentine, about contemporary with
Chaucer, being born in 1335. He was brought up to a commercial
life, but afterwards devoted himself to literature, and took
a considerable part in politics, being sent on various embassies
by the Florentine Republic. On one of them he was plundered
at sea by the Pisan war-ships; and, at a later date, the property
he possessed near Florence was laid waste in the war with Gian
Galeazzo Visconti. The date of his death is uncertain, but it
probably took place during the first few years of the fifteenth
century. He wrote sonnets, <i><span lang="it">canzoni</span></i>, madrigals, and other poems;
but his best known works are his <i><span lang="it">Novelle</span></i> or short stories. They were
originally 300 in number, but we only possess 258, the remainder
having been lost. They are not fitted into any framework, like
that of Boccaccio’s <cite><span lang="it">Decameron</span></cite>. The best of them are of a
humorous character; and the style is more simple and colloquial
than Boccaccio’s. The story given as a specimen probably exists
(under one form or another) in the folk-tales of every European
nation. We possess it in the ballad of “King John and the Abbot
of Canterbury.” (<em>Page <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Alessandro Tassoni</span> was born at Modena in 1565, and died there in
1635, after many intermediate changes of abode. He belonged to
a noble family, but was early left an orphan, and his very moderate
patrimony was further diminished by law-suits, and by the dishonesty
of his guardians. The greater part of his life was spent
at court; he began his career by entering the service of Cardinal
Ascanio Colonna at Rome, and ended it at the Ducal Court of
Modena. He was, like so many Italians of that period, a skilled
politician as well as a finished scholar, and was entrusted with
various diplomatic missions. His principal works belong to the
departments of reflective philosophy and literary criticism, and he
was engaged in an acrimonious controversy wherein the chief
bones of contention were the poetry of Petrarch and the philosophy
of Aristotle, both which idols of the age he attacked
unsparingly; but he is best known to posterity by his heroico-comic
poem of “La Secchia Rapita” (The Stolen Bucket), said
to have been written in 1611. It is based on the tradition that,
during a war between Modena and Bologna, the Modenese forces
(in 1325) carried off a wooden bucket from a public well in the
hostile city. The trophy was hung up in the Cathedral at Modena,
and remained there as a witness to the truth of the story—which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>as a matter of history, is somewhat doubtful, though none the
worse on that account, as the groundwork to Tassoni’s poem.
Many contemporaries of the author’s are introduced under fictitious
names; and, no doubt, the personal element (which is not the
exclusive property of the New Journalism) contributed largely to
the success of the work on its first appearance. But apart from
this, it is genuine burlesque, and good of its kind, the absurdity
being heightened by the introduction of the deities of Olympus in
comically modern guise, to represent (and parody) the “machinery”
which was considered an indispensable ingredient in a serious
epic poem—the “machinery” which, to a certain extent, spoils
the <cite><span lang="it">Jerusalem</span></cite> and the <cite><span lang="it">Lusiad</span></cite>. The passage describing the
assembly of the gods in order to deliberate on the fortunes of
Modena and Bologna, has been chosen for quotation. The
translation is by James Atkinson, and was published in two
volumes (London, 1825). After describing “the rape of the
bucket” by the Modenese, the poem goes on to narrate how the
Bolognese tried to recover it, and challenged the Modenese to
a war of extermination. The latter, though seeing their danger,
made no efforts to put their city in a state of defence by repairing
the ruined fortifications; but contented themselves with appealing
to the Emperor for help, and making alliances with Parma and
Cremona. Fame having carried the report of what had occurred
to Olympus, the Homeric gods assembled in council (as already
mentioned), with the result that Minerva and Apollo declared for
Bologna, as being a city given to arts and learning. Bacchus and
Venus took the part of the merry and pleasure-loving town of
Modena—Mars taking the same side for the love of Venus. These
incite the various terrestrial potentates to take sides in the feud—in
which, at length, the Pope himself interferes. In conclusion,
the bucket is left in possession of the Modenese, while the citizens
of Bologna keep Enzio, King of Sardinia—son of the German
Emperor—who, in fact, ended his days in captivity there. The
poem was defined by Tassoni himself as “a monstrous caprice,”
intended to make game of modern poets; and it is impossible to
give a concise summary of it, more especially as he wove into it
all the burlesque adventures which occurred to him, whether real
or fictitious. Tassoni was, according to an Italian writer, “of a
lively and grotesque fancy, of a cheerful disposition, and fond of
jesting, insomuch that he could not refrain from jokes even in his
will.” Moreover, he was “averse from the prejudices of literary
men, and a lover of novelty”—for which reason he advanced
the monstrous proposition that Petrarch’s <cite><span lang="it">Rime</span></cite> were not the sole
standard of poetry for all ages and all countries. (<em>Page <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>.</em>)</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Achille Torelli</span>, dramatic author, born at Naples, 1844, is said to be
of Albanian descent. His first success was the comedy, <cite><span lang="it">After

then at Turin. This was succeeded by several comedies, most of
which were successful. <cite><span lang="it">La Verità</span></cite>, from which the scene given in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>this volume is extracted, was acted at Naples, Milan, and Turin in
1865. Torelli volunteered for the Italian army in the campaign of
1866, and was laid up for several months in consequence of a fall
from his horse at Custozza. Since then he has produced a long
list of plays, both tragedies and comedies, of which perhaps the
best is <cite><span lang="it">Triste Realtà</span></cite> (1871), which won the applause of the veteran
Manzoni. Angelo de Gubernatis (in the <cite><span lang="it">Dizionario Biografico

notice are gathered) considers <cite><span lang="it">I Mariti</span></cite> Torelli’s masterpiece.
The play is a good one, but has about as much right to be called a
comedy as George Eliot’s <cite><span lang="it">Janet’s Repentance</span></cite>. He leads a very

which has recently been translated under the title, <cite><span lang="it">The House

and pale&#160;... with iron-grey hair and moustache. His lips
are thin, chin somewhat too long, the mouth retreating, the
nose straight, the forehead spacious. He is not handsome, but
has a noble face, a little like that of Dante. His appearance is
that of a man of cold temperament. Some of his speeches—some
pages in his books—are those of a sceptic. As to the coldness,
I do not know whether it would be correct to apply the old
image of Etna—the fire under the snow, But as to the scepticism,
I would take my oath that—contrary to generally received opinion—it
is only apparent. Verga is not an effusive man—certainly
not. But he feels, and he respects—rather, he venerates feeling
even under its most formal manifestations. I met him at a time
when he had recently lost, first, a sister, and then his mother. His
grief was severe and restrained, but deeply felt and lasting. He is
not by any means a sentimental man. Sentimentalism in others
always contracts his lips in that fleeting, ironical smile which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>given him the name of a sceptic.... He is a slow worker. He
observes at his leisure, reflects for a long time, and then retires
into the quiet of his own home to work; but he works not with
the fire of inspiration, but with the sure hand of an artist who has
his picture clearly traced in his mind.” Verga’s most successfully-drawn
characters are taken from the peasantry. Jeli, the horseherd;
Rosso Malpelo, the red-haired waif who had never had
any one to care for him save the father who was buried in the
sand-pits; poor Lucia in <cite><span lang="it">Pane Nero</span></cite>, slowly driven to throw herself
away by sheer dread of starvation; La Santa, bewitched by
the love of Gramigna the brigand,—these, and many more, are
living, breathing figures. But Verga, according to the critic above
quoted, “is ambitious of attaining a perfect knowledge of ‘high
life,’ and describing it truthfully. But in this he is not always
successful. If he draws from life, he certainly does not choose
the best models.” Certainly “Il Come, il Quando, e il Perchè,” is
not a happy effort, and “Jeli il Pastore” is worth a dozen of it.

<p class='c008'>“In <cite>Brand</cite> the hero is an embodied protest against the poverty of
spirit and half-heartedness that Ibsen rebelled against in his countrymen.
In <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> the hero is himself the embodiment of that spirit.
In <cite>Brand</cite> the fundamental antithesis, upon which, as its central theme,
the drama is constructed, is the contrast between the spirit of compromise
on the one hand, and the motto ‘everything or nothing’ on
the other. And <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> is the very incarnation of a compromising
dread of decisive committal to any one course. In <cite>Brand</cite> the problem
of self-realisation and the relation of the individual to his surroundings
is obscurely struggling for recognition, and in <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> it becomes the
formal theme upon which all the fantastic variations of the drama are
built up. In both plays alike the problems of heredity and the influence
of early surroundings are more than touched upon; and both alike
culminate in the doctrine that the only redeeming power on earth or in
heaven is the power of love.”—Mr. <span class='sc'>P. H. Wicksteed</span>.</p>

    <div class='c002'>By CHARLES DAVISON, D.Sc., F.G.S., Author of “The Hereford Earthquake of December 17th, 1896.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The aim of the author, who is a leading authority on this subject, is to
provide a series of studies of a few earthquakes that have been investigated
recently by scientific methods—such as the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857, the
Ischian earthquakes of 1881 and 1883, the Charleston earthquake of 1886, the
Riviera earthquake of 1887, the Japanese earthquake of 1891, the Hereford
earthquake of 1896, the Indian earthquake of 1897, etc.</p>

    <div class='c002'>By W. J. GREENSTREET, M.A., Headmaster of Marling School.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The field of psychological research has been widened by the triple alliance
of psychology, physiology, and sociology—an alliance at once of the most
intimate and fundamental nature, and productive of far-reaching results. It
need, therefore, occasion no surprise that among the volumes of a scientific
series is to be found a treatise dealing with ethical questions. Recent works
on ethics have not been numerous, and the writers seem more anxious to soar
into the realm of lofty thought than to lay the foundations of work that will
be positive and lasting. It would seem that the time has come for a system of
ethics less ambitious in its aims, more restricted in its scope, and based on a
more rigorous method of treatment.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is instructive and interesting to have a complete and comprehensive
account of both our own and foreign systems of education, based upon an
exhaustive study of authoritative and official data. Mr. Hughes has set himself
the task of showing in detail and by a series of pictures, so to speak,
what the four leading nations of the world—England, France, Germany, and
America—are doing in the way of manufacturing citizens. The primary and
secondary systems are described in detail, and the social problems of national
education are described and diagnosed.</p>

it is more than we can endure.... All Ibsen’s characters speak and act
as if they were hypnotised, and under their creator’s imperious demand
to reveal themselves. There never was such a mirror held up to nature
before; it is too terrible.... Yet we must return to Ibsen, with his
remorseless surgery, his remorseless electric-light, until we, too, have
grown strong and learned to face the naked—if necessary, the flayed and
bleeding—reality.</em>’—<span class='sc'>Speaker</span> (London).</p>
